  prompt: |-
    You are comparing a new RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chunk to an old RAG chunk for a given question. Below is the information provided:
    
    [BEGIN DATA]
    ************
    [Question]: {input}
    ************
    [Old RAG Chunk]: {old_chunk}
    ************
    [New RAG Chunk]: {new_chunk}
    ************
    [END DATA]
    
    Carefully compare the **content** and **correctness** of the new RAG chunk against the old RAG chunk. Focus on whether the information in both chunks is consistent, accurate, and relevant to the question. 
    - **Do not consider** any differences in whitespace, style, or formatting (e.g., column names).
    - The new RAG chunk can be similar or different in its content or correctness.

    Based on your analysis, choose one of the following responses:
      - **"Similar"**: The new RAG chunk and the old RAG chunk are meaningfully similar in content and correctness.
      - **"Different"**: The new RAG chunk and the old RAG chunk are meaningfully different in content or correctness.
    
    Select only one option.
