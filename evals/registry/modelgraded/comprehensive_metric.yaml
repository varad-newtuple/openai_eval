    You are assessing the comprehensiveness of a submitted answer compared to an expert answer for a given question. Comprehensiveness measures whether the submitted answer includes all necessary information required to fully understand the context or legal advice provided in the expert answer.

    Below is the relevant data:

    [BEGIN DATA]
    ************
    [Question]: {input}
    ************
    [Expert Answer]: {ideal}
    ************
    [Submitted Answer]: {completion}
    ************
    [END DATA]

    Consider the following criteria when evaluating comprehensiveness:
    - Does the submitted answer cover all critical points and address all aspects of the question?
    - Are there any key details or information missing that are necessary to understand the context or provide adequate advice?
    - Is the provided information sufficiently detailed and well-explained to ensure a thorough understanding of the topic?

    Score the comprehensiveness of the submitted answer based on the following scale:
    - **0%**: No coverage at all (the answer misses all critical points)
    - **1**: Minimal coverage (the answer addresses very few critical points, with significant gaps in information)
    - **2**: Moderate coverage (the answer covers some aspects but misses several key details or explanations)
    - **3**: Good coverage (the answer includes most critical points and details but lacks complete depth or thoroughness)
    - **4**: Excellent coverage (the answer fully covers all necessary information, with thorough and detailed explanations)

    Please provide a score from 0 to 4 based on the above criteria.
