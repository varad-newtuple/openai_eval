similarity-metric:
  prompt: |-
    You are assessing the similarity between a submitted answer and an expert answer for a given question. Similarity measures how closely the submitted answer matches the content and structure of the expert answer, considering key points, information, and logical flow.

    Below is the relevant data:

    [BEGIN DATA]
    ************
    [Question]: {input}
    ************
    [Expert Answer]: {ideal}
    ************
    [Submitted Answer]: {completion}
    ************
    [END DATA]

    Consider the following criteria when evaluating similarity:
    - Does the submitted answer cover the same key points and main ideas as the expert answer?
    - Is the logical flow and structure of the submitted answer similar to the expert answer?
    - Does the submitted answer use equivalent phrasing or vocabulary without deviating in meaning?

    Score the similarity of the submitted answer based on the following scale:
    - **0**: No similarity (the submitted answer is completely different in content and structure)
    - **1**: Minimal similarity (some overlap, but largely different in key points and flow)
    - **2**: Moderate similarity (covers several key points, but with noticeable deviations)
    - **3**: High similarity (covers most key points with a similar logical flow)
    - **4**: Exact similarity (closely matches the content and structure of the expert answer)

    Please provide a score from 0 to 4 based on the above criteria.
