The issue has been examined. The transfer of tenancy rights against tenancy premium which is \\nalso known as \u201cpagadi system\u201d is prevalent in some States. In this system the tenant acquires, tenancy \\nrights in the property against payment of tenancy premium ( pagadi). The landlord may be owner of the \\nproperty but the possession of the same lies with the tenant. The tenant pays periodic rent to the \\nlandlord as long as he occupies the property. The tenant also usually has the option to sell the tenancy \\nright of t he said property and in such a case has to share a percentage of the proceed with owner of \\nland, as laid down in their tenancy agreement. Alternatively, the landlord pays to tenant the prevailing \\ntenancy premium to get the property vacated. Such properties in Maharashtra are governed by \\nMaharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999. \\n3. As per section 9(1) of the CGST Act there shall be levied central tax on the intra -State supplies of \\nservices. The scope of supply includes all forms of supply of goods and services or both such as sale, \\ntransfer, barter, exchange, licence, rental, lease or disposal made or agreed to be made for a \\nconsideration by a person in the course or furtherance of business and also includes the activities \\nspecified in Schedule II. The activity of transfer of tenancy right against consideration in the form of \\ntenancy premium is a supply of service liable to GST. It is a form of lease or renting of property and \\nsuch activity is specifically declared to be a service in para 2 of Schedule II i.e. any l ease, tenancy, \\neasement, licence to occupy land is a supply of services. \\n4. The contention that stamp duty and registration charges is levied on such transfers of tenancy \\nrights, and such transaction thus should not be subjected to GST, is not relevant. Me rely because a \\ntransaction or a supply involves execution of documents which may require registration and payment \\nof registration fee and stamp duty, would not preclude them from the scope of supply of goods and \\nservices and from payment of GST. The transf er of tenancy rights cannot be treated as sale of land or \\nbuilding declared as neither a supply of goods nor of services in para 5 of Schedule III to CGST Act, \\n2017. Thus, a consideration for the said activity shall attract levy of GST. \\n5. To sum up , the activity of transfer of \u2018tenancy rights\u2019 is squarely covered under the scope of \\nsupply and taxable per se . Transfer of tenancy rights to a new tenant against consideration in the form \\nof tenancy premium is taxable. However, renting of resid ential dwelling for use as a residence is \\nexempt [Sl. No. 12 of notification No. 12/2017 -Central Tax (Rate)]. Hence, grant of tenancy rights in \\na residential dwelling for use as residence dwelling against tenancy premium or periodic rent or \\nboth is exempt . As regards services provided by outgoing tenant by way of surrendering the tenancy \\nrights against consideration in the form of a portion of tenancy premium is liable to GST \\n2.1.12.9 Actionable claims, other than lottery, betting and gambling \u2014 Paragraph 6 of \\nSchedule III \\nParagraph 6 of Schedule III reads as under: \\nFor 01.07.2017 to 30.09.2023 \\n6.

An intermediary is a broker, agent, or any other person who arranges or facilitates the supply of goods, services, or securities between two or more persons but does not supply such goods, services, or securities on his own account. This definition emphasizes the role of an intermediary as a facilitator or arranger rather than a principal supplier.\n\n### Key Features of Intermediary Services: As per Circular No. 159/15/2021-GST, dated 22.09.2021\n\n1. **Minimum of Three Parties**: An intermediary service involves at least three parties:\n - Two principals who are transacting in the supply of goods, services, or securities (the main supply).\n - One intermediary who arranges or facilitates this main supply.\n\n2. **Two Distinct Supplies**:\n - **Main Supply**: The core transaction of goods, services, or securities between the two principals.\n - **Ancillary Supply**: The intermediary's service of facilitating or arranging the main supply.\n\n3. **Nature of Service**:\n - An intermediary does not alter the nature or value of the goods, services, or securities supplied.\n - The intermediary's service is distinctly separable from the main supply and often involves a commission.\n\n### Examples of Intermediary Services:\n\n1. **Freight Forwarder**:\n - **As an Intermediary**: A freight forwarder arranging for international shipment acts as an intermediary\n if they are not providing the transportation services themselves but facilitating the transaction between the\n importer/exporter and the shipping company.\n - **Not an Intermediary**: If the freight forwarder provides integrated transportation services and bills the customer directly for a combined service, they act on their own account and are not classified as an intermediary.\n\n2. **Commission Agent**:\n - An agent who helps sell goods by finding buyers and facilitating the sale transaction between a supplier and buyer qualifies as an intermediary.\n - **Illustration**: A person 'C' helping a manufacturer 'A' sell a machine to buyer 'B' and charging 'A' for this service is an intermediary.\n\n3. **Outsourcing Services**:\n - **Not an Intermediary**: If a software company 'A' outsources part of its development work to another company 'C,' where 'C' provides direct service (e.g., module development) to 'A,' 'C' is not an intermediary.\n - **Intermediary**: If a firm 'Q' in India arranges for 'R' to process insurance claims for an insurance company 'P' outside India and charges a commission for this facilitation, 'Q' acts as an intermediary.\n\n### Place of Supply for Intermediary Services:\n\nThe determination of the place of supply is crucial for tax liability. As per Section 13(8) of the IGST Act, the place of supply for intermediary services is considered to be the location of the intermediary. This is noteworthy for determining GST applicability, especially in cross-border transactions.\n\n### Export of Services and Intermediary Services:\n\nIntermediary services do not qualify as \"export of services\" even if the intermediary facilitates transactions for entities outside India because the place of supply is considered the location of the intermediary (Section 13(8) of the IGST Act).\n\n### Judicial Pronouncements and Clarifications:\n\nIn Re: Fulcrum Global Info Services LLP 2019 (30) G.S.T.L. 261 (A.A.R. \u2013 GST-Karnataka), held that \u201cSupport services - Back-end support services\nprovided to client under agreement - Scope of work include trade compliance operations management involving compliance screening relevant to client\u2019s\nbusiness, as instructed and trained by client, helpdesk support services including providing status of shipment to client\u2019s internal and external customers and certain administrative tasks - Details of works entrusted to assessee by client showing that client outsourced its works to assessee and assessee providing his services either updating in system and if system not able to process work, updating it manually - No interaction between assessee and the third persons, either directly or indirectly and assessee concerned only with work entrusted to it on system - Assessee not involved as an intermediary - Assessee\u2019s activities was support service provided to recipient of services - Services classifiable under SAC 9985 more specifically under Service Accounting Code 998599 as \u201cOther support services nowhere else classified in terms of Notification No. 11/2017-C.T. (Rate) - Section 2(13) of Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017.\n\nIn Re: Infinera India Private Limited, 2020 (33) G.S.T.L. 491 (App. A.A.R. - GST - Kar.), held that \u201cIntermediary Service - Pre-sale and marketing service\nprovided by Appellant of the products of overseas client - Infinera US, in a \u201cliaison capacity\u201d is in the nature of facilitating the supply of the products of\noverseas client and not supplying such goods on his own account - Appellant\u2019s service not falling within the ambit of exclusion clause but appropriately\nclassifiable as an \u201cintermediary service\u2019 as defined under Section 2(13) of Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017, there being no difference between the meaning of the term \u201cintermediary\u201d under the GST regime and pre-GST regime.\u201d"}

{"input": [{"role": "system", "content": "As an expert legal consultant, provide a detailed response to the question below, considering the given context: Place of supply of goods or services or both 4.175 \\n2.3 From the perusal of the definition of \u201cintermediary\u201d under IGST Act as well as under Service Tax \\nlaw, it is evident that there is broadly no change in the scope of intermediary services in the GST \\nregime vis-\u00e0-vis the Service Tax regime, except addition of supply of securities in the definition of \\nintermediary in the GST Law. \\n3. Primary Requirements for intermediary services \\nThe concept of intermediary services, as defined above, requires some basic pre -requisites, which are \\ndiscussed below: \\n3.1 Minimum of Three Parties : By definition, an intermediary is someone who arranges or facilitates \\nthe supplies of goods or services or securities between two or more persons. It is thus a natural \\ncorollary that the a rrangement requires a minimum of three parties, two of them transacting in the \\nsupply of goods or services or securities (the main supply) and one arranging or facilitating (the \\nancillary supply) the said main supply. An activity between only two parties c an, therefore, not be \\nconsidered as an intermediary service. An intermediary essentially \u201carranges or facilitates\u201d another \\nsupply (the \u201cmain supply\u201d) between two or more other persons and, does not himself provide the main \\nsupply. \\n3.2 Two distinct supplies : Following are two distinct supplies in case of provision of intermediary \\nservices : \\n(1) Main supply , between the two principals, which can be a supply of goods or services or \\nsecurities. \\n(2) Ancillary supply , which is the service of facilitating or arrang ing the main supply between the \\ntwo principals. This ancillary supply is supply of intermediary service and is clearly identifiable \\nand distinguished from the main supply. \\nA person involved in supply of main supply on principal -to-principal basis to anothe r person cannot be \\nconsidered as supplier of intermediary service. \\n3.3 Intermediary service provider to have the character of an agent, broker or any other similar \\nperson : The definition of \u201cintermediary\u201d itself provides that intermediary service provider means a \\nbroker, an agent or any other person, by whatever name called \u2026.\u201d This part of the definition is not \\ninclusive but uses the expression \u201cmeans\u201d and does not expand the definition by any known expression \\nof expansion such as \u201cand includes\u201d. The use o f the expression \u201carranges or facilitates\u201d in the \\ndefinition of \u201cintermediary\u201d suggests a subsidiary role for the intermediary. It must arrange or facilitate \\nsome other supply, which is the main supply, and does not himself provides the main supply. Thus, the \\nrole of intermediary is only supportive. \\n3.4 Does not include a person who supplies such goods or services or both or securities on his \\nown account: The definition of intermediary services specifically mentions that intermediary \u201c does \\nnot include a per son who supplies such goods or services or both or securities on his own account\u201d. \\nUse of word \u201c such \u201d in the definition with reference to supply of goods or services refers to the main \\nsupply of goods or services or both, or securities, between two or more persons, which are arranged or \\nfacilitated by the intermediary. It implies that in cases wherein the person supplies the main supply, \\neither fully or partly, on principal -to-principal basis, the said supply cannot be covered under the scope \\nof \u201cintermedia ry\u201d. \\n3.5 Sub -contracting for a service is not an intermediary service: An important exclusion from \\nintermediary is sub -contracting. The supplier of main service may decide to outsource the supply of the \\nmain service, either fully or partly, to one or more sub-contractors. Such sub -contractor provides the \\nmain supply, either fully or a part thereof, and does not merely arrange or facilitate the main supply \\nbetween the principal supplier and his customers, and therefore, clearly is not an intermediary. For \\ninstance, \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 have entered into a contract as per which \u2018A\u2019 needs to provide a service of, say, \\nAnnual Maintenance of tools and machinery to \u2018B\u2019. \u2018A\u2019 subcontracts a part or whole of it to \u2018C\u2019. \\nAccordingly, \u2018C\u2019 provides the service of annual maintenan ce to \u2018A\u2019 as part of such sub -contract, by \\nproviding annual maintenance of tools and machinery to the customer of \u2018A\u2019, i.e., to \u2018B\u2019 on behalf of \\n\u2018A\u2019. Though \u2018C\u2019 is dealing with the customer of \u2018A\u2019, but \u2018C\u2019 is providing main supply of Annual"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Explain the concept of intermediary services under gst with examples"}], "ideal": "Under GST, \"intermediary services\" are defined and regulated under Section 2(13) of the Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST) Act, 2017.

Any prudent business man \\nwould recover the costs of such promotional items as part of sale price of \\nproduct s sold to customer, on which GST is paid. Thus, the consideration \\nis in the form of increased sales, when such supplies are done to \\nunrelated persons. \\n9. The terms gift and free sample have not been defined in the GST. \\nHowever, as per the CBIC press release d ated 10th July 2017, in \\ncommon parlance, a gift is made without consideration, is voluntary in \\nnature and is made occasionally. It cannot be demanded as a matter of \\nright. However, the sales promotion scheme is not voluntary in nature \\nand it is a right onc e the targets are achieved by the recipient. Therefore, \\nit cannot be termed as a Gift or free sample. \\n10. When the goods are given as measure of sales promotion or are given for \\nreaching certain sales/turnover targets, then it may be said to be given \u201cin \\ncours e of business\u201d and may not actually be \u201cgifts\u201d but given under \\ncontractual obligations. The input tax credit is eligible and can be availed \\non such goods given away for marketing/promotion to dealers by the \\nsupplier. Circular no. 92/11/2019 -GST Dated 28th June 2019 also \\nprovides that ITC may be claimed where promotional items are given as \\ncombo offers and tax is treated to be paid on such goods as part of that \\ncombo. However, Circular 92/11/2019 was withdrawn by Circular No. \\n112/31/2019 \u2013 GST Dated 03.10.20 19. \\n11. As it is a Sales Promotion Scheme which is used to increase Sales and \\nnot with the intention of giving gifts. Therefore, this cannot be a case of \\nsupply without consideration. \\n12. Noticee also stated that it is not a stand alone supply of free goods as a \\npart of the scheme rather it should be considered as a composite supply \\nfor which we have recovered the cost of the goods distributed free of cost \\nunder the sales promotion scheme. \\n13.

As a result, GST shall be levied on \\nthe supplies made even without consideration between distinct or between related persons on such \\nvalue as determined in accordance with Section 15 of CGST Act, 2017 read with CGST Rules, 2017. \\nThus, supplies without consideration between unrel ated persons or between persons who are not \\ndistinct persons are not subject to tax being not covered in the ambit of supply . \\nWith the implementation of GST , all central statutory forms like \u2018C \u2019, \u2018D\u2019, \u2018 F\u2019 etc . used to support \\ntransfer of material otherwise by way of sale , have been abolished. Thus , a new concept of self -supply \\nhas been introduced wherein transferor unit is liable to pay tax on transfer /supply of material to \\ntransferee unit i.e. its related or distinct person. However, tax paid by transferee to transferor shall be \\navailable as credit to the transferee unit . This concept has been introduced to ensure that flow of credit \\ndoes not g et disturbed. \\nExample \\nRaj Ltd is located in New Delhi and deals in mobile phones. It opens a branch in the State of Punjab \\nfor furtherance of its business. While supplying mobiles to Punjab Branch, New Delhi Branch shall \\ncharge GST at the applicable rate. Punjab Branch shall be liable to make payment of GST in respect \\nof mobile phones supplied by it. However, Punjab Branch shall be eligible to avail input tax credit in \\nrespect of GST charged by New D elhi. Branch. Therefore, flow of credit shall remain intact. \\nThis situation shall also cover transfer of stock including distribution of free samples by the \\nmanufacturer to its own branches. In such a case, distribution of free samples to its own branches, \\nbeing related persons, shall be subject to GST. Further, input tax credit in respect of such samples shall \\nbe allowed to the branches i.e. recipient of stock/free sample . \\nFurthermore, input tax credit reversal, [as provided under Section 17(5)(h) of CGST Act and discussed \\nat length in Chapter 7] shall not be required in the said case as tax has already been paid on such \\nsupply under this Para.

In such \\ncases, ITC is no t required to be reversed. \\nAnother important issue , to be deliberated upon is whether gifting of a pen to his son, (who falls within \\nthe definition of related person), on his birthday by a stationery dealer is a supply in terms of section \\n7(1)(c) read wit h Schedule -I (with benefit of ITC) or it require credit reversal in terms of section \\n17(5)(h) of the Act as discussed supra.

Hence the reference has been given of the above -stated case \\nlaw as the law is Parimateria . \\nAbove -stated judicial pronouncement clearly provides that supply as defined in the Act does not \\nalways involve doing an action on the part of supplier. Merely agreeing to tolerate an act or \\nsituation shall also be considered as supply. In this regard, kind attention is also invited to the case \\nof Maharashtra State Power Generation Company Limited, reported as (2018 (9) TMI 1185 - \\nAppellate Authority For Advance Ruling Maharashtra) wherein Hon\u2019ble Authority held that \\nliquidated damages levied for delayed completion of project shall be exigible to GST as the act of \\ntolerating such delay in completion of contract shall be considered a s supply in terms of Schedule II to \\nCGST Act, 2017. Relevant text of the Advance Ruling reads as under: \\n\u201c48. We have already arrived at the conclusion that in section 3 of the contract the specific \\nclause -7 provides for the levy of liquidated damages if th e project completion is delayed beyond \\nthe scheduled date. This clause leads us to the conclusion that the appellant is in a contractual \\nagreement with the contractor to impose levy of liquidated damages and to accept the amount of \\nliquidated damages in ca se of the completion of the project beyond the scheduled date. Thus, the \\nappellant has tolerated an act or a situation . The purpose of payment of liquidated damages is an \\nact of tolerance in the sense that when there is delay in the completion of the proje ct, the appellant \\nis put to certain hardships which he tolerates in return of the payment of liquidated damages . \\nWhat entry 5 (e) provides that any supply of services of tolerating an act is a supply and therefore \\nthe impugned transaction is also a 'supply' under the provisions of the CGST Act. \\nLet us, for support, refer to the definition of ' liquidated damages' given in the Black Law Dictionary \\nwhich is as under: \u2014 \\nBlack's Law Dictionary (Tenth Edition ) on page 473 defines Liquidated damages thus: \\n\u201cAn amount contractually stipulated as a reasonable estimation of actual damages to be \\nrecovered by one party if the other party breaches.

The issue has been examined. The transfer of tenancy rights against tenancy premium which is \\nalso known as \u201cpagadi system\u201d is prevalent in some States. In this system the tenant acquires, tenancy \\nrights in the property against payment of tenancy premium ( pagadi). The landlord may be owner of the \\nproperty but the possession of the same lies with the tenant. The tenant pays periodic rent to the \\nlandlord as long as he occupies the property. The tenant also usually has the option to sell the tenancy \\nright of t he said property and in such a case has to share a percentage of the proceed with owner of \\nland, as laid down in their tenancy agreement. Alternatively, the landlord pays to tenant the prevailing \\ntenancy premium to get the property vacated. Such properties in Maharashtra are governed by \\nMaharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999. \\n3. As per section 9(1) of the CGST Act there shall be levied central tax on the intra -State supplies of \\nservices. The scope of supply includes all forms of supply of goods and services or both such as sale, \\ntransfer, barter, exchange, licence, rental, lease or disposal made or agreed to be made for a \\nconsideration by a person in the course or furtherance of business and also includes the activities \\nspecified in Schedule II. The activity of transfer of tenancy right against consideration in the form of \\ntenancy premium is a supply of service liable to GST. It is a form of lease or renting of property and \\nsuch activity is specifically declared to be a service in para 2 of Schedule II i.e. any l ease, tenancy, \\neasement, licence to occupy land is a supply of services. \\n4. The contention that stamp duty and registration charges is levied on such transfers of tenancy \\nrights, and such transaction thus should not be subjected to GST, is not relevant. Me rely because a \\ntransaction or a supply involves execution of documents which may require registration and payment \\nof registration fee and stamp duty, would not preclude them from the scope of supply of goods and \\nservices and from payment of GST. The transf er of tenancy rights cannot be treated as sale of land or \\nbuilding declared as neither a supply of goods nor of services in para 5 of Schedule III to CGST Act, \\n2017. Thus, a consideration for the said activity shall attract levy of GST. \\n5. To sum up , the activity of transfer of \u2018tenancy rights\u2019 is squarely covered under the scope of \\nsupply and taxable per se . Transfer of tenancy rights to a new tenant against consideration in the form \\nof tenancy premium is taxable. However, renting of resid ential dwelling for use as a residence is \\nexempt [Sl. No. 12 of notification No. 12/2017 -Central Tax (Rate)]. Hence, grant of tenancy rights in \\na residential dwelling for use as residence dwelling against tenancy premium or periodic rent or \\nboth is exempt .

The key points are summarized below:\n\n1. **Independent Directors or Non-employee Directors**:\n- **GST Applicable**: Remuneration paid to independent directors or those directors who are not employees of the company is subject to GST.\n- **Reverse Charge Mechanism (RCM)**: The company, as the recipient of the director's services, is liable to discharge the applicable GST on the remuneration of such directors under the reverse charge mechanism, as specified in Notification No. 13/2017-Central Tax (Rate) dated 28.06.2017.\n\n2. **Directors Who Are Employees**:\n- **No GST**: Remuneration paid by companies to whole-time directors, including managing directors who are employees, is not subject to GST. These services are considered services by an employee to the employer in the course or in relation to their employment and thus fall under the ambit of entry in Schedule III of the CGST Act, 2017.\n\n### Sitting Fees\nA detailed inspection of the contexts reveals that the context does not explicitly mention sitting fees. However, using the provided information:\n- If sitting fees are paid to independent directors or directors who are not employees, these fees are considered taxable under GST, and the company must pay the GST under RCM.\n- If sitting fees are paid to directors who are employees of the company, such fees are not taxable under GST as they fall under services by an employee to the employer.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased strictly on the provided contexts:\n- GST is applicable on Director sitting fees if paid to independent directors or non-employee directors, and it should be discharged by the company under RCM.\n- If sitting fees are paid to directors who are employees, then such fees are not taxable under GST."}

It was also contended that the Petitioner \\nwas not provided an opportunity of being heard and thus the princip les of \\nnatural justice were violated. While dealing with these grievances, \\nHon\u2019ble Delhi High Court has held, in its operative portion of the \\njudgment - which was reproduced by the ITAT in entirety, as follows: \\n\u201c8. It is clearly admitted by the Respondent t hat it has no jurisdiction \\nto pass any order against the Petitioner hospital under the 2002 \\nRegulations. In fact, it is stated that it has not passed any order against \\nthe Petitioner hospital. Thus, I need not go into the question whether the \\nadequate infr astructure facilities for appropriate post -operative care \\nwere in fact in existence or not in the Petitioner hospital and whether the \\nprinciples of natural justice had been followed or not while passing the \\nimpugned order. Suffice it to say that the observ ations dated 27.10.2012 \\nmade by the Ethics Committee do reflect upon the infrastructure facilities \\navailable in the Petitioner hospital and since it had no jurisdiction to go \\ninto the same, the observations were uncalled for and cannot be \\nsustained. \\n9. Sin ce the MCI had no jurisdiction to go into the infrastructure \\nfacilities, I need not also go into the aspect that in the year 2011, the \\nfacilities available in the hospital were inspected and were found to be in \\norder. \\n10. The petition therefore has to succ eed. I hereby issue a writ of \\ncertiorari quashing the adverse observations passed by the MCI against \\nthe Petitioner hospital highlighted in Para 1 above .\u201d \\nITAT thus held that in their humble understanding, the judgment of \\nDelhi High Court does not negate, dilute, or even deal with, ratio \\ndecidendi of, or even casual observations in, Hon\u2019ble HP High Court\u2019s \\njudgment in the case of Confederation of Indian Pharmaceutical \\nIndustry (discussed earlier). These judgments are in altogether in \\ndifferent field. \\n (vi) ITAT thus noted that while Hon\u2019ble HP High Court dealt with the \\ninterpretation of Explanation to sub -section (1) of section 37, Hon\u2019ble \\nDelhi High Court dealt with the powers of the MCI to pass an order \\nagainst a Hospital in Delhi on the question of adequa cy regarding \\ninfrastructure facilities by Hospitals in Delhi, and that too without \\naffording an opportunity of hearing to the said hospital.

{"input": [{"role": "system", "content": "As an expert legal consultant, provide a detailed response to the question below, considering the given context: 638 Handbook to Income Tax Rules Div. 2 \\nQuestion 2: Refer question No. 7 of the Circular No. 12 of 2022 \u2014 If under the terms of the \\nagreement, the expense incu rred by the service provider is the cost of service recipient and \\nsuch cost is reimbursed by the service recipient to service provider, how is it benefit/perquisite \\nif the bill is not in the name of service recipient? \\nAnswer : In answer to question No. 7 of the Circular No. 12 of 2022, it has been clarified that \\nany expenditure which is the liability of a person carrying out business or profession, if met by the \\nother person is in effect benefit/perquisite provided by the second person to the first person in the \\ncourse of business/profession. \\nNow, if service provider incurs some expense in the course of rendering service to service \\nrecipient and the bill is in the name of service provider, then in substance (irrespective of the terms \\nof the agreement) this ex pense is the liability of the service provider and not of service recipient. It \\nis service provider who gets input credit of GST included in the expenses incurred by him. If it was \\nthe liability of the service recipient, then GST input credit would have be en allowed to him (service \\nrecipient) and not to service provider. Hence, the answer to question No. 7 in the Circular No. 12 \\nof 2022, correctly clarifies that in such a situation reimbursement of such an expense is \\nbenefit/perquisite on which tax is requi red to be deducted under section 194R of the Act. \\nSubsequently, it has been brought to the notice that in GST, if service provider incurs an \\nexpense as \\\"pure agent\\\", then GST input credit is allowed to service recipient and not to service \\nprovider. Broadly speaking a pure agent is one who while making a supply to the recipient, also \\nreceives and incurs expenditure on some other supply on behalf of the recipient and claims \\nreimbursement (as actual, without adding it to the value of his own supply) for such s upplies from \\nthe recipient of the main supply. While the relationship between them (provider of service and \\nrecipient of service) in respect of the main service is on a principal to principal basis, the \\nrelationship between them in respect of other ancilla ry services is that of a pure agent. Under the \\nGST Valuation Rules, 2017 \\\"pure agent\\\" is given the following meaning: \\n\\\"pure agent\\\" means a person who \u2014 \\n (a) enters into a contractual agreement with the recipient of supply to act as his pure agent \\nto incur expenditure or costs in the course of supply of goods or services or both; \\n (b) neither intends to hold nor holds any title to the goods or services or both, so procured \\nor provided as pure agent of the recipient of supply; \\n (c) does not use for his own in terest such goods or services so procured; and \\n (d) receives only the actual amount incurred to procure such goods or services in addition \\nto the amount received for supply he provides on his own account. \\nThe GST valuation rules provide that expenditure in curred as a pure agent, will be excluded \\nfrom the value of supply, and thus also from aggregate turnover. However, such exclusion of \\nexpenditure incurred as a pure agent is possible only and only if all the conditions required to be \\nconsidered as a pure ag ent and further conditions stipulated in the rules are satisfied by the supplier \\nin each case. The supplier would have to satisfy the following conditions (in addition to the \\ncondition required to be satisfied to be considered as a pure agent and discussed above) for \\nexclusion from the value as under: \u2014 \\n (i) the supplier acts as a pure agent of the recipient of the supply, when he makes payment \\nto the third party on authorization by such recipient; \\n (ii) the payment made by the pure agent on behalf of the re cipient of supply has been \\nseparately indicated in the invoice issued by the pure agent to the recipient of service; \\nand \\n (iii) the supplies procured by the pure agent from the third party as a pure agent of the \\nrecipient of supply are in addition to the s ervices he supplies on his own account. \\nIn case these conditions are not satisfied, such expenditure incurred is included in the value of \\nsupply under GST"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Are the costs incurred by a pure agent included in the value of taxable supply?

Its various activities shall include, among other things, booking tickets, sight -seeing etc . \\nThus, there is no doubt that two or more supplies are involved in the instant case. Further, the \\nprincipal supply amongst them is planning, scheduling, organising and arranging the tour which is the \\npredominant element of a composite supply. Various activities such as booking hotels, air tickets, \\nsightsee ing tickets etc. are ancillary and incidental to the main activity of planning, scheduling, \\norganising and arranging tours.

FAQs on Transport and Logistics [Relevant Extract] \\nQuestion 6: Are intermediary and ancillary services, such as, loading/unloading, packing/ \\nunpacking, transshipment and temporary warehousin g, provided in relation to transportation of \\ngoods by road to be treated as part of the GTA service, being a composite supply, or these \\nservices are to be treated as separate supplies. \\nAnswer: The GTA provides service to a person in relation to transportat ion of goods by road in a \\ngoods carriage, which is a composite service. The composite service may include various intermediary \\nand ancillary services, such as, loading/unloading, packing/unpacking, transshipment and temporary \\nwarehousing, which are provide d in the course of transport of goods by road. These services are not \\nprovided as independent services but as ancillary to the principal service, namely, transportation of \\ngoods by road. The invoice issued by the GTA for providing the said service includes the value of \\nintermediary and ancillary services. \\nIn view of this, if any intermediary and ancillary service is provided in relation to transportation of \\ngoods by road, and charges, if any, for such services are included in the invoice issued by the GTA, \\nsuch service would form part of the GTA service and would not be treated as a separate supply. In fact, \\nany service provided along with the GTA service that is part of the composite service of GTA shall be \\ntaxed along with GTA service and not as separate s upplies. \\nHowever, if such incidental services are provided as separate services and charged separately, whether \\nin the same invoice or separate invoices, they shall be treated as separate supplies. \\nQuestion 18: Does the GST treatment on fees for ancillary services in relation to air transport \\nfollow that of the underlying air transport service? \\nAnswer: Yes, ancillary services are part of the service of transporting a passenger by air and do not \\nconstitute a separate supply of service. In this respect, ancil lary services include services that are \\nincidental to the transport of passengers by air (e.g., excess baggage charges, date change charges, un -\\naccompanied minor fees, preferred seat charges, cancellation fees etc.). \\nConsequently, ancillary services shall be treated within the same category of service as transport of \\npassengers by air\u2019 and shall attract the same rate of GST as applicable to the transport of passengers by \\nair"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Airline companies, such as Air India, provide in-flight food and beverages as part of the services included in the ticket cost.

Printing Industry I ssues \\nThe printing industry in India in particular faced a dilemma in determining whether the nature \\nof supply provided was that of goods or services. Another doubt was whether in case where \\ncertain contracts involved both supply of goods and services, whether the same would \\nconstitute a supply of goods or services or if it would be a composite supply and in case it is, \\nthen what would constitute the principal supply. \\nThus, it is clarified that supply of books, pamphlets, brochures, envelopes, annual reports, \\nleaflets, cartons, boxes etc. printed with logo, design, name, address or other contents supplied \\nby the recipient of such printed goods, are composite supplies and the question, whether such \\nsupplies constitute supply of goods or services would be determined on the basis of what \\nconstitutes the principal supply. \\nIn the case of printing of books, pamphlets, brochures, annual reports, and the like, where only \\ncontent is supplied by the publisher or the person who owns the usage rights to the intangible \\ninputs while the physical inputs including paper used for printing belong to the printer, supply \\nof printing [of the content supplied by the recipient of supply] is the principal supply and \\ntherefore such supplies would constitute supply of service. \\nIn case of supply of printed envelopes, letter cards, printed boxes, tissues, napkins, wall paper \\netc. by the printer using its physical inputs including paper to print the design, logo etc. supplied \\nby the recipient of goods, predominant supply is supply of goods and the supply of printing of \\nthe content [supplied by the recipient of supply] is ancillary to the principal supply of goods and \\ntherefore such supplies would constitute supply of goods. \\n12.

It is pertinent to mention here that consumption of input for \\nmanufacturing is natural and inherent to the manufac turing process. It \\nneeds to be understood in the context of a manufacturing process. The \\ninput used in the manufacturing process is either fully utilized during the \\nmanufacturing process, consumed fully or partly or left in part in the \\nform of waste or scr ap. The inclusion of such part of input in the \\ndefinition of \u2018goods lost\u2019 is not correct interpretation and is unjustifiable \\nas the total quantity of inputs that is used in the making of finished \\nproduct represents the complete inputs including scrap part or \\nconsumption part. \\n8.

Hon\u2019ble Court made observations that, the provisions of \\nSection 19 of the TNVAT Act is reiterated in the provisions of Section \\n17 of the CGST Act, and held that, Sec tion 17(5)(h) of the CGST Act \\nindicates loss of inputs that are different from consumption of inputs in \\nmanufacturing processes and can be quantifiable. A loss happened to the \\nentity of input during manufacturing process of a product is natural and \\ninheren t to the process of manufacture itself. \\n10. The noticee also Relied on the judgement of the Hon\u2019ble Madras High \\nCourt in the case of Rupa & Co.

Further, court held that the reversal of ITC, in cases of loss by \\nconsumption of input which is natural and inh erent to manufacturing loss \\nis misconceived, as such loss is not contemplated or covered by the \\nsituations described under Section 17(5)(h) of the CGST Act. The \\nconditions set out in clause (h) indicate loss of inputs that are \\nquantifiable and involve exte rnal factors or compulsions. A loss of a \\nportion of input in the process of manufacture is one that is inherent to \\nthe process of manufacture itself. Accordingly, ITC reversal under \\nSection 17(5)(h) will not be sustainable. \\n12. Similar view was taken in the ca se of General Manager Ordnance \\nFactory Bhandara 2020 -VIL-36-AAAR . The AAAR held that inputs \\nconsumed in testing process cannot be treated as goods lost. Once any \\ninput used in the manufacturing process, it sacrifice its identity to final \\nproduct and cannot be accounted as Lost goods. \\n13. It is crystal clear with the views of Hon\u2019ble Madras High Court in ARS \\nSteels and AAAR in General Manager Ordnance Factory that inputs \\nwhich used in any manufacturing process loses their identity and can be \\nsaid to be used in m anufacturing process, It is irrelevant whether some \\nportion of them are consumed or left out as scrap during the \\nmanufacturing process. The inherent nature of such goods or \\nmanufacturing process should not be declared as goods lost. It is a loss of \\nidentit y of input rather than a loss of inputs. \\n14. Also to add to this the fact that the erstwhile Central Excise Law had \\nplethora of judg ment on similar lines & it is a well established principle \\nthat loss inherent in manufacturing should be viewed more as consumed \\nin the process rather than being considered as goods lost.

These notified registered persons are required to prepare invoice by \\nreporting their invoice data in Form GST INV -1 on the Invoice Registration Portal (IRP) and \\nafter obtaining a unique Invoice Reference Number (IRN). The documents (invoices, debit \\nnotes, credit notes) reported on the IRP are then transmitted electronically to the Common \\nPortal and are auto -populated in the respective tables of Form GSTR -1[Details of outward \\nsupplies ]. E-invoicing is identical with \u2018clearance model\u2019 where an invoice is required to be \\nreported and cleared by the Government on a designated portal before being shared with the \\nbuyer. Real time reporting of B2B invoices under e -invoicing is a remarkable step in automated \\ndata gathering of GST in e -invoicing system. \\n Meaning of e -invoicing \\n\u2018E-Invoicing\u2019 or \u2018electronic invoicing\u2019 is a system in which B2B invoices are authenticated \\nelectronically by Goods and Services Tax Network (G STN) for further use on the common \\nGST portal. Under the electronic invoicing system, an identification number is issued against \\nevery invoice by the Invoice Registration Portal (IRP) which is managed by the GSTN. \\nHowever, e -invoic ing does not mean generat ion of invoice by IRP/ a Governmental Portal. \\nAll invoice information is transferred from IRP to both the GST portal and e -way bill portal in \\nreal-time. Thus, e -invoicing eliminates the need for manual data entry while furnishing Form \\nGSTR -1[Details of out ward supplies ] and generation of Part -A of the e -way bills, as the \\ninformation is passed directly by the IRP to the Common Portal. \\nApplicability of e -invoicing -N.

No. Here the payments are being made against a single contract value of taxable supply exceeding \\nRs.2.5 Lakh. Here, the value of taxable supply in the contract is Rs. 3.5 lakh.
