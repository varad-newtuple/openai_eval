The issue has been examined. The transfer of tenancy rights against tenancy premium which is \\nalso known as \u201cpagadi system\u201d is prevalent in some States. In this system the tenant acquires, tenancy \\nrights in the property against payment of tenancy premium ( pagadi). The landlord may be owner of the \\nproperty but the possession of the same lies with the tenant. The tenant pays periodic rent to the \\nlandlord as long as he occupies the property. The tenant also usually has the option to sell the tenancy \\nright of t he said property and in such a case has to share a percentage of the proceed with owner of \\nland, as laid down in their tenancy agreement. Alternatively, the landlord pays to tenant the prevailing \\ntenancy premium to get the property vacated. Such properties in Maharashtra are governed by \\nMaharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999. \\n3. As per section 9(1) of the CGST Act there shall be levied central tax on the intra -State supplies of \\nservices. The scope of supply includes all forms of supply of goods and services or both such as sale, \\ntransfer, barter, exchange, licence, rental, lease or disposal made or agreed to be made for a \\nconsideration by a person in the course or furtherance of business and also includes the activities \\nspecified in Schedule II. The activity of transfer of tenancy right against consideration in the form of \\ntenancy premium is a supply of service liable to GST. It is a form of lease or renting of property and \\nsuch activity is specifically declared to be a service in para 2 of Schedule II i.e. any l ease, tenancy, \\neasement, licence to occupy land is a supply of services. \\n4. The contention that stamp duty and registration charges is levied on such transfers of tenancy \\nrights, and such transaction thus should not be subjected to GST, is not relevant. Me rely because a \\ntransaction or a supply involves execution of documents which may require registration and payment \\nof registration fee and stamp duty, would not preclude them from the scope of supply of goods and \\nservices and from payment of GST. The transf er of tenancy rights cannot be treated as sale of land or \\nbuilding declared as neither a supply of goods nor of services in para 5 of Schedule III to CGST Act, \\n2017. Thus, a consideration for the said activity shall attract levy of GST. \\n5. To sum up , the activity of transfer of \u2018tenancy rights\u2019 is squarely covered under the scope of \\nsupply and taxable per se . Transfer of tenancy rights to a new tenant against consideration in the form \\nof tenancy premium is taxable. However, renting of resid ential dwelling for use as a residence is \\nexempt [Sl. No. 12 of notification No. 12/2017 -Central Tax (Rate)]. Hence, grant of tenancy rights in \\na residential dwelling for use as residence dwelling against tenancy premium or periodic rent or \\nboth is exempt . As regards services provided by outgoing tenant by way of surrendering the tenancy \\nrights against consideration in the form of a portion of tenancy premium is liable to GST \\n2.1.12.9 Actionable claims, other than lottery, betting and gambling \u2014 Paragraph 6 of \\nSchedule III \\nParagraph 6 of Schedule III reads as under: \\nFor 01.07.2017 to 30.09.2023 \\n6.

An intermediary is a broker, agent, or any other person who arranges or facilitates the supply of goods, services, or securities between two or more persons but does not supply such goods, services, or securities on his own account. This definition emphasizes the role of an intermediary as a facilitator or arranger rather than a principal supplier.\n\n### Key Features of Intermediary Services: As per Circular No. 159/15/2021-GST, dated 22.09.2021\n\n1. **Minimum of Three Parties**: An intermediary service involves at least three parties:\n - Two principals who are transacting in the supply of goods, services, or securities (the main supply).\n - One intermediary who arranges or facilitates this main supply.\n\n2. **Two Distinct Supplies**:\n - **Main Supply**: The core transaction of goods, services, or securities between the two principals.\n - **Ancillary Supply**: The intermediary's service of facilitating or arranging the main supply.\n\n3. **Nature of Service**:\n - An intermediary does not alter the nature or value of the goods, services, or securities supplied.\n - The intermediary's service is distinctly separable from the main supply and often involves a commission.\n\n### Examples of Intermediary Services:\n\n1. **Freight Forwarder**:\n - **As an Intermediary**: A freight forwarder arranging for international shipment acts as an intermediary\n if they are not providing the transportation services themselves but facilitating the transaction between the\n importer/exporter and the shipping company.\n - **Not an Intermediary**: If the freight forwarder provides integrated transportation services and bills the customer directly for a combined service, they act on their own account and are not classified as an intermediary.\n\n2. **Commission Agent**:\n - An agent who helps sell goods by finding buyers and facilitating the sale transaction between a supplier and buyer qualifies as an intermediary.\n - **Illustration**: A person 'C' helping a manufacturer 'A' sell a machine to buyer 'B' and charging 'A' for this service is an intermediary.\n\n3. **Outsourcing Services**:\n - **Not an Intermediary**: If a software company 'A' outsources part of its development work to another company 'C,' where 'C' provides direct service (e.g., module development) to 'A,' 'C' is not an intermediary.\n - **Intermediary**: If a firm 'Q' in India arranges for 'R' to process insurance claims for an insurance company 'P' outside India and charges a commission for this facilitation, 'Q' acts as an intermediary.\n\n### Place of Supply for Intermediary Services:\n\nThe determination of the place of supply is crucial for tax liability. As per Section 13(8) of the IGST Act, the place of supply for intermediary services is considered to be the location of the intermediary. This is noteworthy for determining GST applicability, especially in cross-border transactions.\n\n### Export of Services and Intermediary Services:\n\nIntermediary services do not qualify as \"export of services\" even if the intermediary facilitates transactions for entities outside India because the place of supply is considered the location of the intermediary (Section 13(8) of the IGST Act).\n\n### Judicial Pronouncements and Clarifications:\n\nIn Re: Fulcrum Global Info Services LLP 2019 (30) G.S.T.L. 261 (A.A.R. \u2013 GST-Karnataka), held that \u201cSupport services - Back-end support services\nprovided to client under agreement - Scope of work include trade compliance operations management involving compliance screening relevant to client\u2019s\nbusiness, as instructed and trained by client, helpdesk support services including providing status of shipment to client\u2019s internal and external customers and certain administrative tasks - Details of works entrusted to assessee by client showing that client outsourced its works to assessee and assessee providing his services either updating in system and if system not able to process work, updating it manually - No interaction between assessee and the third persons, either directly or indirectly and assessee concerned only with work entrusted to it on system - Assessee not involved as an intermediary - Assessee\u2019s activities was support service provided to recipient of services - Services classifiable under SAC 9985 more specifically under Service Accounting Code 998599 as \u201cOther support services nowhere else classified in terms of Notification No. 11/2017-C.T. (Rate) - Section 2(13) of Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017.\n\nIn Re: Infinera India Private Limited, 2020 (33) G.S.T.L. 491 (App. A.A.R. - GST - Kar.), held that \u201cIntermediary Service - Pre-sale and marketing service\nprovided by Appellant of the products of overseas client - Infinera US, in a \u201cliaison capacity\u201d is in the nature of facilitating the supply of the products of\noverseas client and not supplying such goods on his own account - Appellant\u2019s service not falling within the ambit of exclusion clause but appropriately\nclassifiable as an \u201cintermediary service\u2019 as defined under Section 2(13) of Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017, there being no difference between the meaning of the term \u201cintermediary\u201d under the GST regime and pre-GST regime.\u201d"}

{"input": [{"role": "system", "content": "As an expert legal consultant, provide a detailed response to the question below, considering the given context: Place of supply of goods or services or both 4.175 \\n2.3 From the perusal of the definition of \u201cintermediary\u201d under IGST Act as well as under Service Tax \\nlaw, it is evident that there is broadly no change in the scope of intermediary services in the GST \\nregime vis-\u00e0-vis the Service Tax regime, except addition of supply of securities in the definition of \\nintermediary in the GST Law. \\n3. Primary Requirements for intermediary services \\nThe concept of intermediary services, as defined above, requires some basic pre -requisites, which are \\ndiscussed below: \\n3.1 Minimum of Three Parties : By definition, an intermediary is someone who arranges or facilitates \\nthe supplies of goods or services or securities between two or more persons. It is thus a natural \\ncorollary that the a rrangement requires a minimum of three parties, two of them transacting in the \\nsupply of goods or services or securities (the main supply) and one arranging or facilitating (the \\nancillary supply) the said main supply. An activity between only two parties c an, therefore, not be \\nconsidered as an intermediary service. An intermediary essentially \u201carranges or facilitates\u201d another \\nsupply (the \u201cmain supply\u201d) between two or more other persons and, does not himself provide the main \\nsupply. \\n3.2 Two distinct supplies : Following are two distinct supplies in case of provision of intermediary \\nservices : \\n(1) Main supply , between the two principals, which can be a supply of goods or services or \\nsecurities. \\n(2) Ancillary supply , which is the service of facilitating or arrang ing the main supply between the \\ntwo principals. This ancillary supply is supply of intermediary service and is clearly identifiable \\nand distinguished from the main supply. \\nA person involved in supply of main supply on principal -to-principal basis to anothe r person cannot be \\nconsidered as supplier of intermediary service. \\n3.3 Intermediary service provider to have the character of an agent, broker or any other similar \\nperson : The definition of \u201cintermediary\u201d itself provides that intermediary service provider means a \\nbroker, an agent or any other person, by whatever name called \u2026.\u201d This part of the definition is not \\ninclusive but uses the expression \u201cmeans\u201d and does not expand the definition by any known expression \\nof expansion such as \u201cand includes\u201d. The use o f the expression \u201carranges or facilitates\u201d in the \\ndefinition of \u201cintermediary\u201d suggests a subsidiary role for the intermediary. It must arrange or facilitate \\nsome other supply, which is the main supply, and does not himself provides the main supply. Thus, the \\nrole of intermediary is only supportive. \\n3.4 Does not include a person who supplies such goods or services or both or securities on his \\nown account: The definition of intermediary services specifically mentions that intermediary \u201c does \\nnot include a per son who supplies such goods or services or both or securities on his own account\u201d. \\nUse of word \u201c such \u201d in the definition with reference to supply of goods or services refers to the main \\nsupply of goods or services or both, or securities, between two or more persons, which are arranged or \\nfacilitated by the intermediary. It implies that in cases wherein the person supplies the main supply, \\neither fully or partly, on principal -to-principal basis, the said supply cannot be covered under the scope \\nof \u201cintermedia ry\u201d. \\n3.5 Sub -contracting for a service is not an intermediary service: An important exclusion from \\nintermediary is sub -contracting. The supplier of main service may decide to outsource the supply of the \\nmain service, either fully or partly, to one or more sub-contractors. Such sub -contractor provides the \\nmain supply, either fully or a part thereof, and does not merely arrange or facilitate the main supply \\nbetween the principal supplier and his customers, and therefore, clearly is not an intermediary. For \\ninstance, \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 have entered into a contract as per which \u2018A\u2019 needs to provide a service of, say, \\nAnnual Maintenance of tools and machinery to \u2018B\u2019. \u2018A\u2019 subcontracts a part or whole of it to \u2018C\u2019. \\nAccordingly, \u2018C\u2019 provides the service of annual maintenan ce to \u2018A\u2019 as part of such sub -contract, by \\nproviding annual maintenance of tools and machinery to the customer of \u2018A\u2019, i.e., to \u2018B\u2019 on behalf of \\n\u2018A\u2019. Though \u2018C\u2019 is dealing with the customer of \u2018A\u2019, but \u2018C\u2019 is providing main supply of Annual"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Explain the concept of intermediary services under gst with examples"}], "ideal": "Under GST, \"intermediary services\" are defined and regulated under Section 2(13) of the Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST) Act, 2017.
