{"input": [{"role": "system", "content": "As an expert legal consultant, provide a detailed response to the question below, considering the given context: Scope of Intermediary services:\n\n2.1 \u2018Intermediary\u2019 has been defined in the sub-section (13) of section 2 of the\nIntegrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 (hereinafter referred to as \u201cIGST\u201d\nAct) as under\u2013\n\u201cIntermediary means a broker, an agent or any other person, by whatever\nname called, who arranges or facilitates the supply of goods or services or both,\nor securities, between two or more persons, but does not include a person who\nsupplies such goods or services or both or securities on his own account.\u201d\n\n2.2 The concept of \u2018intermediary\u2019 was borrowed in GST from the Service\nTax Regime. The definition of \u2018intermediary\u2019 in the Service Tax law as given in\nRule 2(f) of Place of Provision of Services Rules, 2012 issued vide notification\nNo. 28/2012-ST, dated 20-6-2012 was as follows:\n\u201cintermediary\u201d means a broker, an agent or any other person, by whatever\nname called, who arranges or facilitates a provision of a service (hereinafter\ncalled the \u2018main\u2019 service) or a supply of goods, between two or more persons, but\ndoes not include a person who provides the main service or supplies the goods on\nhis account;\u201d\n\n2.3 From the perusal of the definition of \u201cintermediary\u201d under IGST Act as\nwell as under Service Tax law, it is evident that there is broadly no change in the\nscope of intermediary services in the GST regime vis-\u00e0-vis the Service Tax\nregime, except addition of supply of securities in the definition of intermediary in\nthe GST Law.\n\n3. Primary Requirements for intermediary services:\nThe concept of intermediary services, as defined above, requires some basic\nprerequisites, which are discussed below:\n\n3.1 Minimum of Three Parties: By definition, an intermediary is someone\nwho arranges or facilitates the supplies of goods or services or securities between\ntwo or more persons. It is thus a natural corollary that the arrangement requires a\nminimum of three parties, two of them transacting in the supply of goods or\nservices or securities (the main supply) and one arranging or facilitating (the\nancillary supply) the said main supply. An activity between only two parties can,\ntherefore, NOT be considered as an intermediary service. An intermediary\nessentially \u201carranges or facilitates\u201d another supply (the \u201cmain supply\u201d) between\ntwo or more other persons and, does not himself provide the main supply.\n\n3.2 Two distinct supplies: As discussed above, there are two distinct supplies\nin case of provision of intermediary services;\n\n(1) Main supply, between the two principals, which can be a supply of goods\nor services or securities;\n\n(2) Ancillary supply, which is the service of facilitating or arranging the main\nsupply between the two principals. This ancillary supply is supply of\nintermediary service and is clearly identifiable and distinguished from the main\nsupply.\n\nA person involved in supply of main supply on principal to principal basis to\nanother person cannot be considered as supplier of intermediary service.\n\n3.3 Intermediary service provider to have the character of an agent,\nbroker or any other similar person: The definition of \u201cintermediary\u201d itself\nprovides that intermediary service provider means a broker, an agent or any other person, by whatever name called....\u201d. This part of the definition is not inclusive but uses the expression \u201cmeans\u201d and does not expand the definition by any known expression of expansion such as \u201cand includes\u201d. The use of the expression\"arranges or facilitates\u201d in the definition of \u201cintermediary\u201d suggests a subsidiary\nrole for the intermediary. It must arrange or facilitate some other supply, which is\nthe main supply, and does not himself provides the main supply. Thus, the role of ntermediary is only supportive.\n\n3.4 Does not include a person who supplies such goods or services or\nboth or securities on his own account: The definition of intermediary services\nspecifically mentions that intermediary \u201cdoes not include a person who supplies\nsuch goods or services or both or securities on his own account\u201d. Use of word\n\u201csuch\u201d in the definition with reference to supply of goods or services refers to the\nmain supply of goods or services or both, or securities, between two or more\npersons, which are arranged or facilitated by the intermediary. It implies that in\ncases wherein the person supplies the main supply, either fully or partly, on\nprincipal to principal basis, the said supply cannot be covered under the scope of\n\u201cintermediary\u201d.\n\n3.5 Sub-contracting for a service is not an intermediary service: An\nimportant exclusion from intermediary is sub-contracting. The supplier of main\nservice may decide to outsource the supply of the main service, either fully or\npartly, to one or more sub-contractors. Such sub-contractor provides the main\nsupply, either fully or a part thereof, and does not merely arrange or facilitate the\nmain supply between the principal supplier and his customers, and therefore,\nclearly is not an intermediary. For instance, \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 have entered into a\ncontract as per which \u2018A\u2019 needs to provide a service of, say, Annual Maintenance\nof tools and machinery to \u2018B\u2019. \u2018A\u2019 subcontracts a part or whole of it to \u2018C\u2019.\nAccordingly, \u2018C\u2019 provides the service of annual maintenance to \u2018A\u2019 as part of\nsuch sub-contract, by providing annual maintenance of tools and machinery to\nthe customer of \u2018A\u2019, i.e. to \u2018B\u2019 on behalf of \u2018A\u2019. Though \u2018C\u2019 is dealing with the\ncustomer of \u2018A\u2019, but \u2018C\u2019 is providing main supply of Annual Maintenance\nService to \u2018A\u2019 on his own account, i.e. on principal to principal basis. In this\ncase, \u2018A\u2019 is providing supply of Annual Maintenance Service to \u2018B\u2019, whereas \u2018C\u2019\nis supplying the same service to \u2018A\u2019. Thus, supply of service by \u2018C\u2019 in this case\nwill not be considered as an intermediary.\n\n3.6 The specific provision of place of supply of \u2018intermediary services\u2019 under\nsection 13 of the IGST Act shall be invoked only when either the location of\nsupplier of intermediary services or location of the recipient of intermediary\nservices is outside India.\n\n4. Applying the abovementioned guiding principles, the issue of intermediary\nservices is clarified through the following illustrations:\n\nIllustration 1 \u2018A\u2019 is a manufacturer and supplier of a machine. \u2018C\u2019 helps \u2018A\u2019\nin selling the machine by identifying client \u2018B\u2019 who wants to purchase this\nmachine and helps in finalizing the contract of supply of machine by \u2018A\u2019 to \u2018B\u2019.\n\u2018C\u2019 charges \u2018A\u2019 for his services of locating \u2018B\u2019 and helping in finalizing the sale\nof machine between \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019, for which \u2018C\u2019 invoices \u2018A\u2019 and is paid by \u2018A\u2019\nfor the same. While \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 are involved in the main supply of the\nmachinery, \u2018C\u2019, is facilitating the supply of machine between \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019. In this\narrangement, \u2018C\u2019 is providing the ancillary supply of arranging or facilitating the\n\u2018main supply\u2019 of machinery between \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 and therefore, \u2018C\u2019 is an\nintermediary and is providing intermediary service to \u2018A\u2019.\n\nIllustration 2 \u2018A\u2019 is a software company which develops software for the\nclients as per their requirement. \u2018A\u2019 has a contract with \u2018B\u2019 for providing some\ncustomized software for its business operations.\n\u2018A\u2019 outsources the task of design and development of a particular module of\nthe software to \u2018C\u2019, for which \u201cC\u2019 may have to interact with \u2018B\u2019, to know their\nspecific requirements. In this case, \u2018C\u2019 is providing main supply of service of\ndesign and development of software to \u2018A\u2019, and thus, \u2018C\u2019 is not an intermediary\nin this case.\n\nIllustration 3 An insurance company \u2018P\u2019, located outside India, requires to\nprocess insurance claims of its clients in respect of the insurance service being\nprovided by \u2018P\u2019 to the clients. For processing insurance claims, \u2018P\u2019 decides to\noutsource this work to some other firm. For this purpose, he approaches \u2018Q\u2019,\nlocated in India, for arranging insurance claims processing service from other\nservice providers in India. \u2018Q\u2019 contacts \u2018R\u2019, who is in business of providing such\ninsurance claims processing service, and arranges supply of insurance claims\nprocessing service by \u2018R\u2019 to \u2018P\u2019. \u2018Q\u2019 charges P a commission or service charge of\n1% of the contract value of insurance claims processing service provided by \u2018R\u2019\nto \u2018P\u2019. In such a case, main supply of insurance claims processing service is\nbetween \u2018P\u2019 and \u2018R\u2019, while \u2018Q\u2019 is merely arranging or facilitating the supply of\nservices between \u2018P\u2019 and \u2018R\u2019, and not himself providing the main supply of\nservices. Accordingly, in this case, \u2018Q\u2019 acts as an intermediary as per definition\nof sub-section (13) of section 2 of the IGST Act.\n\nIllustration 4 \u2018A\u2019 is a manufacturer and supplier of computers based in USA\nand supplies its goods all over the world. As a part of this supply, \u2018A\u2019 is also\nrequired to provide customer care service to its customers to address their queries\nand complains related to the said supply of computers. \u2018A\u2019 decides to outsource\nthe task of providing customer care services to a BPO firm, \u2018B\u2019. \u2018B\u2019 provides\ncustomer care service to \u2018A\u2019 by interacting with the customers of \u2018A\u2019 and\naddressing/processing their queries/complains. \u2019B\u2019 charges \u2018A\u2019 for this service.\n\u2018B\u2019 is involved in supply of main service \u2018customer care service\u2019 to \u2018A\u2019, and\ntherefore, \u2018B\u2019 is not an intermediary.\n\n5. The illustrations given in para 4 above are only indicative and not\nexhaustive. The illustrations are also generic in nature and should not be\ninterpreted to mean that the service categories mentioned therein are inherently\neither intermediary services or otherwise. Whether or not, a specific service\nwould fall under intermediary services within the meaning of sub-section (13) of\nsection 2 of the IGST Act, would depend upon the facts of the specific case.\nWhile examining the facts of the case and the terms of contract, the basic\ncharacteristics of intermediary services, as discussed in para 3 above should be\nkept in consideration.\n\nAdvance Rulings\n\nIn Re: Fulcrum Global Info Services LLP 2019 (30) G.S.T.L. 261 (A.A.R. \u2013\nGST-Karnataka), held that \u201cSupport services - Back-end support services\nprovided to client under agreement - Scope of work include trade compliance\noperations management involving compliance screening relevant to client\u2019s\nbusiness, as instructed and trained by client, helpdesk support services including\nproviding status of shipment to client\u2019s internal and external customers and\ncertain administrative tasks - Details of works entrusted to assessee by client\nshowing that client outsourced its works to assessee and assessee providing his\nservices either updating in system and if system not able to process work,\nupdating it manually - No interaction between assessee and the third persons,\neither directly or indirectly and assessee concerned only with work entrusted to it\non system - Assessee not involved as an intermediary - Assessee\u2019s activities was\nsupport service provided to recipient of services - Services classifiable under\nSAC 9985 more specifically under Service Accounting Code 998599 as \u201cOther\nsupport services nowhere else classified in terms of Notification No. 11/2017-\nC.T.

Scope of Intermediary services\n2.1 \u2018Intermediary\u2019 has been defined in the sub-section (13) of section 2 of the Integrated Goods and\nServices Tax Act, 2017 (hereinafter referred to as \u201cIGST\u201d Act) as under\u2014\n\u201cIntermediary means a broker, an agent or any other person, by whatever name called, who\narranges or facilitates the supply of goods or services or both, or securities, between two or more\npersons, but does not include a person who supplies such goods or services or both or securities\non his own account.\u201d\n2.2 The concept of \u2018intermediary\u2019 was borrowed in GST from the Service Tax Regime. The definition\nof \u2018intermediary\u2019 in the Service Tax law as given in Rule 2(f) of Place of Provision of Services Rules,\n2012 issued vide Notification No. 28/2012-ST, dated 20-6-2012 was as follows: \u2014\n\n\u201cintermediary\u201d means a broker, an agent or any other person, by whatever name called, who\narranges or facilitates a provision of a service (hereinafter called the \u2018main\u2019 service) or a supply\nof goods, between two or more persons, but does not include a person who provides the main\nservice or supplies the goods on his account;\u201d\n2.3 From the perusal of the definition of \u201cintermediary\u201d under IGST Act as well as under Service Tax\nlaw, it is evident that there is broadly no change in the scope of intermediary services in the GST\nregime vis-\u00e0-vis the Service Tax regime, except addition of supply of securities in the definition of\nintermediary in the GST Law.\n3. Primary Requirements for intermediary services\nThe concept of intermediary services, as defined above, requires some basic pre-requisites, which are\ndiscussed below:\n3.1 Minimum of Three Parties: By definition, an intermediary is someone who arranges or facilitates\nthe supplies of goods or services or securities between two or more persons. It is thus a natural\ncorollary that the arrangement requires a minimum of three parties, two of them transacting in the\nsupply of goods or services or securities (the main supply) and one arranging or facilitating (the\nancillary supply) the said main supply. An activity between only two parties can, therefore, not be\nconsidered as an intermediary service. An intermediary essentially \u201carranges or facilitates\u201d another\nsupply (the \u201cmain supply\u201d) between two or more other persons and, does not himself provide the main\nsupply.\n3.2 Two distinct supplies: Following are two distinct supplies in case of provision of intermediary\nservices:\n(1) Main supply, between the two principals, which can be a supply of goods or services or\nsecurities.\n(2) Ancillary supply, which is the service of facilitating or arranging the main supply between the\ntwo principals. This ancillary supply is supply of intermediary service and is clearly identifiable\nand distinguished from the main supply.\nA person involved in supply of main supply on principal-to-principal basis to another person cannot be\nconsidered as supplier of intermediary service.\n3.3 Intermediary service provider to have the character of an agent, broker or any other similar\nperson: The definition of \u201cintermediary\u201d itself provides that intermediary service provider means a\nbroker, an agent or any other person, by whatever name called....\u201d This part of the definition is not\ninclusive but uses the expression \u201cmeans\u201d and does not expand the definition by any known expression\nof expansion such as \u201cand includes\u201d. The use of the expression \u201carranges or facilitates\u201d in the\ndefinition of \u201cintermediary\u201d suggests a subsidiary role for the intermediary. It must arrange or facilitate\nsome other supply, which is the main supply, and does not himself provides the main supply. Thus, the\nrole of intermediary is only supportive.\n3.4 Does not include a person who supplies such goods or services or both or securities on his\nown account: The definition of intermediary services specifically mentions that intermediary \u201cdoes\nnot include a person who supplies such goods or services or both or securities on his own account\u201d.\nUse of word \u201csuch\u201d in the definition with reference to supply of goods or services refers to the main\nsupply of goods or services or both, or securities, between two or more persons, which are arranged or\nfacilitated by the intermediary. It implies that in cases wherein the person supplies the main supply,\neither fully or partly, on principal-to-principal basis, the said supply cannot be covered under the scope\nof \u201cintermediary\u201d.\n3.5 Sub-contracting for a service is not an intermediary service: An important exclusion from\nintermediary is sub-contracting. The supplier of main service may decide to outsource the supply of the\nmain service, either fully or partly, to one or more sub-contractors. Such sub-contractor provides the\nmain supply, either fully or a part thereof, and does not merely arrange or facilitate the main supply\nbetween the principal supplier and his customers, and therefore, clearly is not an intermediary. For\ninstance, \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 have entered into a contract as per which \u2018A\u2019 needs to provide a service of, say,\n\nAnnual Maintenance of tools and machinery to \u2018B\u2019. \u2018A\u2019 subcontracts a part or whole of it to \u2018C\u2019.\nAccordingly, \u2018C\u2019 provides the service of annual maintenance to \u2018A\u2019 as part of such sub-contract, by\nproviding annual maintenance of tools and machinery to the customer of \u2018A\u2019, i.e., to \u2018B\u2019 on behalf of\n\u2018A\u2019. Though \u2018C\u2019 is dealing with the customer of \u2018A\u2019, but \u2018C\u2019 is providing main supply of Annual\nMaintenance Service to \u2018A\u2019 on his own account, i.e., on principal-to-principal basis. In this case, \u2018A\u2019 is\nproviding supply of Annual Maintenance Service to \u2018B\u2019, whereas \u2018C\u2019 is supplying the same service to\n\u2018A\u2019. Thus, supply of service by \u2018C\u2019 in this case will not be considered as an intermediary.\n3.6 The specific provision of place of supply of \u2018intermediary services\u2019 under section 13 of the IGST\nAct shall be invoked only when either the location of supplier of intermediary services or location of\nthe recipient of intermediary services is outside India.\n4. Applying the abovementioned guiding principles, the issue of intermediary services is clarified\nthrough the following illustrations:\nIllustration 1\n\u2018A\u2019 is a manufacturer and supplier of a machine. \u2018C\u2019 helps \u2018A\u2019 in selling the machine by identifying\nclient \u2018B\u2019 who wants to purchase this machine and helps in finalizing the contract of supply of machine\nby \u2018A\u2019 to \u2018B\u2019. \u2018C\u2019 charges \u2018A\u2019 for his services of locating \u2018B\u2019 and helping in finalizing the sale of\nmachine between \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019, for which \u2018C\u2019 invoices \u2018A\u2019 and is paid by \u2018A\u2019 for the same. While \u2018A\u2019\nand \u2018B\u2019 are involved in the main supply of the machinery, \u2018C\u2019, is facilitating the supply of machine\nbetween \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019. In this arrangement, \u2018C\u2019 is providing the ancillary supply of arranging or\nfacilitating the \u2018main supply\u2019 of machinery between \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 and therefore, \u2018C\u2019 is an intermediary\nand is providing intermediary service to \u2018A\u2019.\nIllustration 2\n\u2018A\u2019 is a software company which develops software for the clients as per their requirement.\n\u2018A\u2019 has a contract with \u2018B\u2019 for providing some customized software for its business operations.\n\u2018A\u2019 outsources the task of design and development of a particular module of the software to \u2018C\u2019, for\nwhich \u201cC\u2019 may have to interact with \u2018B\u2019, to know their specific requirements. In this case, \u2018C\u2019 is\nproviding main supply of service of design and development of software to \u2018A\u2019, and thus, \u2018C\u2019 is not an\nintermediary in this case.\nIllustration 3\nAn insurance company \u2018P\u2019, located outside India, requires to process insurance claims of its clients in\nrespect of the insurance service being provided by \u2018P\u2019 to the clients. For processing insurance claims,\n\u2018P\u2019 decides to outsource this work to some other firm. For this purpose, he approaches \u2018Q\u2019, located in\nIndia, for arranging insurance claims processing service from other service providers in India. \u2018Q\u2019\ncontacts \u2018R\u2019, who is in business of providing such insurance claims processing service and arranges\nsupply of insurance claims processing service by \u2018R\u2019 to \u2018P\u2019. \u2018Q\u2019 charges P a commission or service\ncharge of 1% of the contract value of insurance claims processing service provided by \u2018R\u2019 to \u2018P\u2019. In\nsuch a case, main supply of insurance claims processing service is between \u2018P\u2019 and \u2018R\u2019, while \u2018Q\u2019 is\nmerely arranging or facilitating the supply of services between \u2018P\u2019 and \u2018R\u2019, and not himself providing\nthe main supply of services. Accordingly, in this case, \u2018Q\u2019 acts as an intermediary as per definition of\nsub-section (13) of section 2 of the IGST Act.\nIllustration 4\n\u2018A\u2019 is a manufacturer and supplier of computers based in USA and supplies its goods all over the\nworld. As a part of this supply, \u2018A\u2019 is also required to provide customer care service to its customers to\naddress their queries and complains related to the said supply of computers. \u2018A\u2019 decides to outsource\nthe task of providing customer care services to a BPO firm, \u2018B\u2019. \u2018B\u2019 provides customer care service to\n\u2018A\u2019 by interacting with the customers of \u2018A\u2019 and addressing/processing their queries/complains. \u2019B\u2019\ncharges \u2018A\u2019 for this service. \u2018B\u2019 is involved in supply of main service \u2018customer care service\u2019 to \u2018A\u2019,\nand therefore,\u2019 \u2018B\u2019 is not an intermediary.\n5. The illustrations given in para 4 above are only indicative and not exhaustive. The illustrations are\nalso generic in nature and should not be interpreted to mean that the service categories mentioned therein are inherently either intermediary services or otherwise. Whether or not, a specific service\nwould fall under intermediary services within the meaning of sub-section (13) of section 2 of the IGST\nAct, would depend upon the facts of the specific case.

{"input": [{"role": "system", "content": "As an expert legal consultant, provide a detailed response to the question below, considering the given context: 1. Provision of Taxable Service\nAs per the charging section i.e. Section 9 of the CGST Act, 2017, the taxable\nevent under GST includes \u201csupply\u201d of goods or services or both. For a supply to\nattract GST, the supply must be taxable. Taxable supply has been broadly defined\nin terms of Section 2(108) of the CGST Act, 2017, means any supply of goods or\nservices or both which, is leviable to tax under this Act.\n2. Meaning and Scope of Supply\nAs per statutory definition contained in Section 7(1) of the CGST Act, 2017,\nthe expression \u2018supply\u2019 includes the following\u2014\n(a) all forms of supply of goods or services or both such as sale, transfer,\nbarter, exchange, licence, rental, lease or disposal made or agreed to be\nmade for a consideration by a person in the course or furtherance of\nbusiness;\n(b) import of services for a consideration whether or not in the course or\nfurtherance of business;\n(c) the activities specified in Schedule I, made or agreed to be made without\na consideration; and\n(d) the activities to be treated as supply of goods or supply of services as\nreferred to in Schedule II.\n3. Scope of Levy on Contract employment\nFurther, Schedule III of CGST Act, 2017 has specified that the activities or\ntransactions which is to be treated neither as supply of goods nor a supply of\nservices. In this regard Section 7(2)(1) of the CGST Act, 2017 specifies that Services by an employee to the employer in the course of or in relation to his\nemployment shall be neither a supply of goods nor supply of services. In other\nwords the consideration paid by the employer to the employee under the contract\nof employment is outside the purview or scope of levy of GST.\n4. Consideration paid to the Employee\nIt is submitted that the consideration paid to the employee by employer in the\ncourse of employment is not confined to only monthly salary or monetary\nconsideration. The word consideration has wider meaning it includes other\namenities, allowances or reimbursement expenses paid to the employees. Such\nnon-monetary consideration paid to the employees by the employers as per the\ncontractual agreement during the tenure of the employment may be summarized\nas under:\n\uf0d8 Fix allowances as per letter of appointment - travel allowances, uniform\nallowances, transport allowances, daily allowances etc.,\n\uf0d8 Amenities provided to employees - accommodation, first aid or medical\ncheckup at company\u2019s dispensary, tea coupon, lunch coupon, car facility\nfor office work, computer or laptop for work,\n\uf0d8 Reimbursement of expenses incurred by employees - medical expenses,\nhouse rent, driver salary, leave travel expenses, conveyance expenses for\noffice work, lodging and boarding expenses on official tour.\nThe aforesaid allowances, amenities, perquisites and reimbursement\nexpenses are provided by the employers to employees as per employment\ncontract are out of the scope of GST since these transactions in the course of\nemployment contract are neither supply of services nor supply of goods.\n5. Levy of GST on supply of food or beverages or any other articles for\nconsumption to employees\nIt is pertinent to mention that as per provisions in sub-section (1)(d) of\nSection 7 of the CGST Act, 2017 \u201csupply\u201d includes \u201cthe activities to be treated\nas supply of goods or supply of services as referred to in schedule II\u201d. As regards\ntreatment of \u201ccomposite supply\u201d as \u201csupply of goods\u201d, reference may be made to\nClause 6(b) of Schedule-II of CGST Act, 2017, which is reproduced below for\nready reference:\n\u201cSupply, by way of or as part of any service or in any other manner\nwhatsoever, of goods, being food or any other article for human consumption\nor any drink (other than alcoholic liquor for human consumption), where\nsuch supply or service is for cash, deferred payment or other valuable\nconsideration.\u201d\nTherefore, the canteen services provided to the employees viz; supply of\nfood or beverages or any other articles for consumption to employees and if\nmonthly charge is deducted from their salary towards expenses incurred for\nsubsidized food etc., such supply of canteen services qualifies for treatment of\nsupply of goods for the purpose of levy GST.\n6. Taxability of Employees Gift\nThere is confusion in GST law about the employer-employee relationship. As\nper proviso in Schedule I, Entry 2 of the CGST Act, 2017, gifts up to `50,000/-\nin value in a financial year by employer to an employee shall not be treated as\nsupply of goods or services or both. Any gift exceeding `50,000/- in value in a\nfinancial year shall be treated as supply and taxable under GST.\n7. C.B.I & C, Clarification Contractual agreement and payment of\nperquisites by employer to employee is not subject to GST\nSchedule III of the CGST Act, prescribes that \u2018services by employee to the\nemployer in the course of contractual agreement or in relation to his employment\n\u2018will not be considered as supply of goods or supply of services and hence not\ntaxable under GST.\nBut any perquisites provided by the employer to its employee in terms of\ncontractual agreement entered into between the employer and the employee will\nnot be subjected to levy of GST-Circular No. 172/04/2022-GST, dated 6-7-2022.\n8.

Columbia Asia Hospitals Private Limited (\u201cthe\nApplicant\u201d) is a private limited company and is an international healthcare group\noperating a chain of modern hospitals across Asia. The Applicant is currently\noperating across six different states having eleven hospitals out of which six units\nare in the state of Karnataka. The Applicant has its India Management Office\n(\u201cIMO\u201d) i.e. Corporate Office in Karnataka and some of the activities for all the\nunits with respect to accounting, administration and maintenance of IT system\nare carried out by the employees from IMO which forms part of the registered\nperson in Karnataka.\nIssue involved: \u201cWhether the activities performed by the employees at the\ncorporate office in the course of or in relation to employment such as accounting,\nother administrative and IT system maintenance for the units located in the other\nstates as well i.e. distinct persons as per Section 25(4) of the CGST Act, 2017\nshall be treated as supply as per Entry 2 of Schedule 1 of the CGST Act to attract\nGST or it shall not be treated as supply of services as per Entry 1 of Schedule III\nof the CGST Act, 2017?\u201d\nAAR Observations\n\uf0d8 Since the IMO is covered under one registration in the state of Karnataka\nand the other units are covered under different registrations and the units\nare controlled by the IMO, they both are related persons. By implication,\nany supply of goods and services from IMO to the separately registered\nunits would amount to supply of goods and services, even if made\nwithout consideration (As per Entry 2 of Schedule I);\nThe valuation of such services is to be done as per the provisions of\nSection 15 of the CGST Act and if any consideration is charged by issue\nof invoice by the IMO to the respective units would amount to transfer\nand hence supply as it is in the course of business under clause (a) of\nsub-section (1) of Section 7 of the CGST Act, 2017;\n\uf0d8 The employees employed in the Corporate Office are providing services\nto the Corporate Office and hence there is an employee-employer\nrelationship only in the IMO. The other offices are distinct persons and\ntherefore the employers in the IMO have no employer-employee\nrelationship with other offices. Hence Entry I of Schedule III (i.e. neither\na supply of goods nor supply of services) is not applicable;\n\uf0d8 Further, the activities made between the related persons are treated as\nsupplies and the valuation includes all costs, the employee cost also\nneeds to be taken into consideration at the time of valuation of goods or\nservices provided by one distinct entity to other distinct entities.\nAAR Rulings: The activities performed by the employees at the corporate\noffice in the course of or in relation to employment such as accounting, other\nadministrative and IT system maintenance for the units located in the other states\nas well i.e. distinct persons as per Section 25(4) of the CGST Act shall be treated\nas supply as per Entry 2 Schedule I of the CGST Act, 2017.\n* * *\n\nCase Law:\nThe decision of Hon\u2019ble High Court of Madras in the case of GE T & D\n\nIndia Limited. v Deputy Commissioner of Central Excise, reported in 2020-VIL-\n39-MAD-ST, wherein it was held that \u201ca contract of employment qua an\n\nemployer and employee has to be read as a whole, there are situations within a\n\ncontract that constitute rendition of service such as breach of a stipulation of non-\ncompete. Notice pay, in lieu of sudden termination however, does not give rise to\n\nthe rendition of service either by the employer or the employee.\u201d\nThus, the decision of the Hon\u2019ble Madras High has categorically stated that\n\u2018Notice pay\u2019 does not render any service either by the employer or the employee\nby which the payment of notice not qualify as service and payment service on\nnotice pay does not arise.\nIn Re: Clay Craft (India) Pvt.

Ltd, services provided by employees from the corporate office to units in other states are treated as supplies between distinct persons, thereby attracting GST (context from the advance ruling stating intra-group services as taxable when provided to distinct persons).\n\n4. **Specific Inclusions and Exclusions**:\n - Certain services linked with perquisites provided under a contractual agreement between employer and employee are also not subjected to GST (Circular No. 172/04/2022-GST). However, gifts exceeding the value of Rs. 50,000 in a financial year are treated as a supply and are taxable under GST (context reference on the treatment of gifts).\n\nIn conclusion, services provided by an employee to their employer within the scope of employment are not taxable under GST. However, services rendered outside this scope, such as contractual services provided to other entities or companies, are subject to GST."}
{"input": [{"role": "system", "content": "As an expert legal consultant, provide a detailed response to the question below, considering the given context: 1. Meaning of Intellectual Property Right\nIntellectual Property Right (IPR) is not a new concept in the modern world.\nIntellectual Property Rights are set of rights associated with creations of the\nhuman mind that spontaneously emerges from application of intellect, which may\nbe in the form of an invention, design, trademark, formula, product process,\ntechnology, book, goodwill etc. So an output of the human mind may contribute\nto creation of intellectual property rights. Intellectual property has been\nrecognized as a very important asset for any business in the present scenario of\nworld economy. Intellectual property rights are protected by statutory laws.\n2. Protection of Intellectual Property Rights\nIn India Government has made legislation for the protection of Intellectual\nProperty Rights namely, Patents Act, Copyright Act. Trademarks Act and\nDesigns Act. With regard to protection of Intellectual property rights in other\ncountries, they follow the international legal instruments. The establishment of\nthe World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) is an important milestone\nin the history of human-kind that recognizes the legitimate rights of the creator of\nthe work and protects him against unfair competition.\n3. Taxable event under GST\n\u201cSupply\u201d is the taxable event under GST, in place of \u201ctaxable goods \u201cand\n\u201ctaxable services\u201d as was prevailed in the earlier tax laws for the purpose of levy\nof tax. Section 2(108) of the CGST Act, defines \u201cTaxable supply\u201d means a\nsupply of goods or services or both which is leviable to tax under GST. Thus,\nGST is levied upon the \u201csupplies of goods and services\u201d. Section 9(1) of the CGST Act, states that tax shall be levied on the transaction value of a supply of\ngoods or services or both.\n4. Definition of \u201cGoods\u201d\nSection 2(52) of the CGST Act, \u201cgoods\u201d means every kind of movable\nproperty other than money and securities but includes actionable claim, growing\ncrops, grass and things attached to or forming part of the land which are agreed to\nbe severed before supply or under a contract of supply;\n5. Definition of \u201cServices\u201d\nSection 2(102) of the CGST Act, \u201cservices\u201d means anything other than\ngoods, money and securities but includes activities relating to the use of money\nor its conversion by cash or by any other mode, from one form, currency or\ndenomination, to another form, currency or denomination for which a separate\nconsideration is charged;\n6. Intellectual Property Rights under GST\nEven though, Intellectual Property Rights has not been defined under CGST\nAct; by plain reading of the definition of \u201cgoods\u201d it is clear that Intellectual\nProperty Rights qualifies as goods. Further, section 5(c) of schedule II of the\nCGST Act, specified that \u201ctemporary transfer or permitting the use or enjoyment\nof any intellectual property right to be considered as supply of services.\nAccordingly, the Central Government, on the recommendations of the GST\nCouncil, have notified the taxable rates of \u201cIntellectual property rights \u201cboth\nunder classification of goods as well as classification of services.\n7. Classification & rate of Services of IPR\nWhile notifying the taxable rates of services vide Notification No. 11/2017\n(Rate), dated 28-6-2017 has classified Intellectual Property Rights at Sl. No. 17\nare reproduced as under:\nS.\nNo.\nChapter/Section/\nHeading\n\nDescription of Service Rate of Tax\n@\n\n17 Heading 9973\n(Leasing or rental\nservices, with or\nwithout operator)\n\n(i) Temporary or Permanent transfer\nor permitting the use or enjoyment\nof Intellectual Property (IP) right\nin respect of goods other than\nInformation Technology software.\n12%\n(6% CGST +\n6% SGST)\n\n(ii) Temporary or permanent transfer\nor permitting the use or enjoyment\nof Intellectual Property (IP) right\nin respect of Information\nTechnology Software.\n\n18%\n(9% CGST +\n9% SGST)\n\nThe scheme of \u201cclassification of services\u201d for the Heading 9973 only\nprovides for licensing services (temporary transfer) for right to use the IPR.\nGenerally, the End User Licence Agreement is the legal contract between a\nsoftware application author or publisher and the user of that application\ngoverning the usage. The agreement is renewable and/or could be amended from\ntime to time. To find out as to whether there is an element of supply involved\nwhen software is delivered to its customer; the terms and conditions of End User\nLicence Agreement are material. The contract for supply therefore assumes\nsignificant in this test to decide whether or not there has been \u2018temporary transfer\nor permitting the use or enjoyment of any intellectual property right.\nThus temporary/permanent transfer a particular intellectual property right\nwould be considered as supply of service and 12% tax would be levied on the\ntransaction value provided such IPR is not in respect of software. The\nsale/licensing of intellectual property right pertaining to software would be\ncharged 18% tax.\nIt is pertinent to mention that the Constitutional amendment Act, 2016 did\nnot amend Article 366(29A)(d) which specifies that the transfer of the right to\nuse any goods is to be deemed as a sale of those goods. Further, once IPR is\ntreated as goods, a permanent transfer of such IPR would amount to a sale of\ngoods; will be the same as to a supply of goods. However, the Central\nGovernment while notifying the tax rate of services has classified the transfer of\nthe right to use any goods to be treated as service.\n8. Classification & rate of goods of IPR\nWhile taxable rates of goods were notified vide Notification No. 1/2017-C.T.\n(Rate), dated 28-6-2017, unfortunately this notification did not contains any\nspecific entry or rates for taxing Intellectual Property Rights as goods.\nSubsequently, as per the recommendations made by the GST Council meeting\nheld on 10th November, 2017, rates of Intellectual property rights has been\ninserted at Sl. No. 243 of amended Notification No. 41/2017-C.T. (Rate), dated\n14-11-2017, which is reproduced as under:\nS.\nNo.\nChapter/Heading/\nSub-heading/\nTariff item\n\nDescription of Goods Rate of\nTax @\n\n243 Any Chapter Permanent transfer of Intellectual\nProperty (IP) right in respect of\ngoods other than Information\nTechnology software.\n\n12%\n(6% CGST +\n6% SGST)\nThe above classification of goods and tax rates relating to permanent transfer\nof Intellectual Property right in respect of goods other than IT software will\nattract tax @ 12%, which is equal to service classification notification. It is\npertinent to mention that when the rate of \u201cIntellectual property rights \u201chas been\ninserted under goods notification, corresponding deletion has not been done to\nthe service notification. This amendment has given a confirmation that\npermanent transfer of intellectual property rights would be taxed as supply of\ngoods where as temporary transfer of intellectual property rights would be taxed\nas supply of services. This dual classification of tax rates would create unnecessary procedural problems, relating to time of supply, place of supply,\ninvoicing, accounting of ITC credit and proper availment of ITC credit.\n9. Tax Rates of IGST for Goods\nFurther, the Central Government on the recommendations of the GST\nCouncil has notified the tax rates of integrated tax for goods vide Notification\nNo. 1/2017-I.T., dated 28-6-2017 and shall be\nCharged in respect of inter-State supplies of goods as under:\n(i) 5% in respect of goods specified in Schedule-I.\n(ii) 12% in respect of goods specified in Schedule-II.\n(iii) 18% in respect of goods specified in Schedule-III.\n(iv) 28% in respect of goods specified in Schedule-IV.\n(v) 3% in respect of goods specified in Schedule V and\n(vi) 25% in respect of goods specified in Schedule-VI.\nThe details of schedules with chapter heading has been annexed to the said\nNotification, the tax shall be levied on inter-State supplies of goods, the\ndescription of which is specified in the corresponding entry in column (3) of the\nsaid schedules, falling under the Heading/sub-heading/Tariff item or chapter, as\nthe case may be, as specified in the corresponding entry in column (2) of the said\nSchedules. The chapter heading/sub-heading which is specified in the First\nSchedule to the Customs Tariff Act, 1975. In order to tax goods both column 2\nand column 3 have to read conjunctively.\nOn perusal of all schedules and chapter headings annexed to the said\nNotification, unfortunately there is no chapter covering of IPR under the Customs\nTariff Act, 1975. The Central Government as well as GST Council has failed to\n\ntake note of the same to declare tax rates for IPR to be charged tax rate for inter-\nState supplies of IPR.\n\nLater, the Central Government with recommendation of GST Council has\nbrought amendment to the said tax rates vide Notification No. 43/2017-I.T.\n(Rate), dated 14-11-2017, which is extracted as under:\nS.\nNo.\nChapter/\nHeading/\nsub-heading/\nTariff item\n\nDescription of Goods Rate of Tax @\n\n243 Any Chapter Permanent transfer of Intellectual\nProperty (IP) right in respect of goods\nother than Information Technology\nsoftware.\n\n12%\n(6% CGST +\n6% IGST)\nThe above table is showing tax rate has been inserted vide said Notification\ndated 14th November, 2017 for IPR, wherein it is specified that a permanent\ntransfer of Intellectual Property Right (IPR) is to be taxed @12% (6% CGST +\n6% IGST) (in Schedule II) for inter-State supplies. It is pertinent to mention there are no chapter heading/tariff heading of Customs rather it has been mentioned as\n\u201cany chapter\u201d then is it proper to charge IGST without any chapter heading or\nsub-heading of Customs. It may be questioned by the taxpayers whether to pay\nIGST or not in the absence of chapter heading.\nThe tax rate for services under Heading 9973 as classified under GST will\ncreate confusion as well as litigation. There is need of proper classification of\nIPR/tax rates of CGST, SGST & IGST for goods. It is pertinent to mention that\nthere is no rate of tax on IPR as goods during the period 1st July\u20192017 to 13th\nNovember\u20192017. The Central Government as well as GST Council even though\nhas notified tax rate of IPR as goods by inserting necessary entry in CGST rate\nand IGST rate but both the Notifications have been declared as prospective.\nSince the imposition of rate is not retrospective to cover the tax rate period from\n1st July\u20192017 to 13th November\u20192017, demands raised on permanent transfer of\nIPR will create litigations in the coming days.\nThus, It is observed that, under GST is the dual Classification of rate of tax\non IPR needs to be reviewed by the GST Council and necessary clarification may\nbe issued for smooth tax collection and reduction of probable litigation on\naccount of interpretation of taxability on IPR in the coming days.\n10. FAQ for GST on IT/ITES\nQuestion 1: Whether software is regarded as goods or services in GST?\nAnswer: In terms of Schedule II of the CGST Act, 2017, development,\ndesign, programming, customisation, adaptation, upgradation, enhancement,\nimplementation of information technology software and temporary transfer or\npermitting the use or enjoyment of any intellectual property right are treated as\nservices.\nBut, if a pre-developed or pre-designed software is supplied in any medium/\nstorage (commonly bought off-the-shelf) or made available through the use of\nencryption keys, the same is treated as a supply of goods classifiable under\nheading 8523.\nQuestion 2: What are the implications of recognising the development, design,\nprogramming, customisation, adaptation, upgradation, enhancement, and\nimplementation of information technology software as a service?\nAnswer: The primary implication is that the place of supply rules applicable\nto services would apply in determining taxability of the supply of software\nservices. The same would be applicable in situations of supply of services\ninvolving a temporary transfer or permitting the use or enjoyment of any\nintellectual property right. The other implication is that the supplier of software\nservices would not be eligible for the composition scheme.\nQuestion 3: \u2018A\u2019 is a dealer in Computers and Computer parts having turnover\nof Rs. 8 lakh in a year; does \u2018A\u2019 have to register under GST?\nAnswer: Every supplier located in a State or Union territory, whose\n\u201caggregate turnover\u201d in a financial year exceeds twenty lakh rupees, is liable to\nbe registered under GST. This limit of turnover for a special category State is ten lakh rupees. \u2018A\u2019, whose aggregate turnover is only Rs. 8 lakh in a year, is\ntherefore not liable to registration.\nQuestion 4: The registered person \u2018B\u2019 receives small portions of software code\nfrom individuals which he then integrates and supply as a package to clients.\nThese individuals are having small turnover of Rs. 5 to 10 lakh, and therefore\nare not registered in GST. Whether there is any liability on \u2018B\u2019 in respect of\nservices provided by such individuals?\nAnswer: If the supplies are made by unregistered suppliers, GST is liable to\nbe paid by the recipient, who is a registered person, under section 9(4) of the\nCGST Act, 2017. Therefore, in this case \u2018B\u2019 is liable to pay GST on services\nprovided by these individuals. \u2018B\u2019 can claim credit of this tax paid by him on\nreverse charge.\nQuestion 5: What is the rate of tax on IT services?\nAnswer: The rate of GST on IT services is 18%.\nQuestion 6: Whether exports of software services attract GST?\n\nAnswer: Exports and supplies to SEZ units and SEZ developers are zero-\nrated in GST. Zero-rating effectively means that no tax is payable on exports but\n\nthe exporter/supplier is entitled to the input tax credit on inputs/input services\nused in relation to exports. The exporters have two options for zero rating, which\nare as follows:\n(1) To pay integrated tax on supplies meant to be exported and get refund of\ntax so paid after the supply is exported.\n(2) To make export supplies under a bond or letter of undertaking and claim\nrefund of taxes suffered on inputs and input services in relation to such\nexports.\nQuestion 7: How do I determine whether IT services provided by me constitute\nexport of service?\nAnswer: The supply of any service is considered an export of service, where\nthe following conditions are met:\n(1) the supplier of service is located in India;\n(2) the recipient of service is located outside India;\n(3) the place of supply of service is outside India;\n(4) the payment for such service has been received by the supplier of service\nin convertible foreign exchange; and\n(5) the supplier of service and the recipient of service are not merely\nestablishments of a distinct person in accordance with explanation 1 of\nsection 8 of the IGST Act, 2017.\nQuestion 8: How do I determine the place of supply of IT/ITES services?\nAnswer: Place of supply of IT/ITES services is the location of the recipient\nin terms of section 12 and 13 of the IGST Act, 2017. However, if the recipient is not registered and his address is not available on the records of the supplier, the\nplace of supply would be the location of the supplier.\nQuestion 9: How to determine the location of the recipient?\nAnswer: Location of the recipient of service is defined in section 2(14) of\nthe IGST Act. A recipient of services is treated as located outside India if his\nplace of business where he receives services is outside India or, if he does not\nhave a place of business, his usual place of residence is outside India.\nQuestion 10: Would I be liable to pay GST on reverse charge even if the\nforeign supplier of software from whom I buy for use in my firm registered\nunder GST was to accept the payment in Indian Rupees?\nAnswer: Yes, you would be liable to pay GST. A supply is treated as an\nimport of service if the following conditions are satisfied:\n(1) the supplier of service is located outside India;\n(2) the recipient of service is located in India; and\n(3) the place of supply of service is in India.\nThe place of such supply would be taken to be the location where the firm is\nregistered (in GST) and the supplies would attract integrated tax (IGST). The\nfactum of which currency was used to pay the consideration is immaterial.\nQuestion 11: I am an Indian Company who makes software and sells it outside\nthe country. I have hired a firm (not a related party) \u2018C\u2019 located abroad to\nfacilitate the supply of software in Europe and the USA; would I be liable to\npay GST on the payments that I make to this entity abroad?\nAnswer: No. In this case, \u2018C\u2019 is covered by the definition of \u2018intermediary\u2019\n[section 2(13) of the IGST Act, 2017]. The place of supply of such intermediary\nservice is location of the supplier in terms of section 13(8) of the IGST Act,\n2017. As \u2018C\u2019 is located outside India, GST is not payable in this case.\nQuestion 12: What factors determine the location of \u2018C\u2019 (in question 11) as\nbeing outside India?\nAnswer: In terms of section 2(15) of the IGST Act, 2017, the location of a\nservice provider is to be determined by applying the following steps sequentially:\n(1) where a supply is made from a place of business for which the\nregistration has been obtained, the location of such place of business;\n(2) where a supply is made from a place other than the place of business for\nwhich registration has been obtained (a fixed establishment elsewhere),\nthe location of such fixed establishment;\n(3) where a supply is made from more than one establishment, whether the\nplace of business or fixed establishment, the location of the\nestablishment most directly concerned with the provision of the supply;\nand\n(4) in absence of such places, the location of the usual place of residence of\nthe supplier. The location of \u2018C\u2019 is to be determined by applying the criterion from (2), or\n(3), or as the case may be, (4).\nQuestion 13: I am an agent in India of a foreign IT/ITES provider (principal\nlocated outside India). For agency services, I bill the principal in convertible\nforeign exchange. Whether GST liability arises in this case?\nAnswer: You are an intermediary and the place of supply of the service\nprovided by you to the principal is in India irrespective of the mode of payment.\nHence, GST is payable on the services provided by you as an intermediary to the\nprincipal.\nQuestion 14: I have more than one SEZ unit in different States; do I need to\ntake separate registrations? Also, I have two SEZ units in one State. Can I take\na single registration?\nAnswer: (1) Yes. Under GST, every entity shall take GST registration in\neach State from which it makes taxable supplies. However, a single registration\ncan be taken for all your SEZ units within a State, whether located in one SEZ or\nmore than one SEZ.\n(2) A person having unit(s) in a Special Economic Zone as well as outside\nthe SEZ in a State shall make a separate application for registration for SEZ\nunit(s) as a business vertical distinct from his other units located outside the\nSpecial Economic Zone in that State (Refer Rule 8(1) of CGST Rules, 2017).\nQuestion 15: I have a unit in the DTA and another in the SEZ; can I take a\ncommon registration?\nAnswer: No. A person having unit(s) in a Special Economic Zone as well as\noutside the SEZ in a State, shall make a separate application for registration for\nSEZ unit(s) as a business vertical distinct from his other units located outside the\nSpecial Economic Zone in that State (Refer Rule 8(1) of CGST Rules, 2017).\nQuestion 16: If I supply a laptop bag along with the laptop to my customer,\nwhat would be the rate of tax leviable?\nAnswer: If the laptop bag is supplied along with the laptop in the ordinary\ncourse of business, the principal supply is that of the laptop and the bag is an\nancillary. Therefore, it is a composite supply and the rate of tax would that as\napplicable to the laptop.\nQuestion 17: I am obtaining online database access services from a company\nabroad over the net, would I have to pay tax on reverse charge?\nAnswer: The recipient, if registered, has to pay the applicable IGST on\nreverse charge basis. If the recipient is not registered, the matter is treated as an\nonline information and database access or retrieval service (OIDAR) and the\nOIDAR service provider is liable to take registration and pay tax.\nQuestion 18: When would it be construed that I have made a supply of services\ninvolving temporary transfer or permitting the use or enjoyment of any\nintellectual property right?\nAnswer: Generally, the End User Licence Agreement (EULA) is the legal\ncontract between a software application author or publisher and the user of that\napplication governing the usage. The agreement is renewable and/or could be\namended from time to time. To find out as to whether there is an element of\nsupply involved when software is delivered to its customer, the terms and\nconditions of EULA are material.\nThe contract for supply therefore assumes significance in this test to decide\nwhether or not there has been \u2018temporary transfer or permitting the use or\nenjoyment of any intellectual property right\u2019.\nQuestion 19: What special provisions are attracted in GST with regard to\nassociated enterprises?\nAnswer: An enterprise which participates, either directly or indirectly,\nthrough one or more intermediaries, in the management, or control or capital of\nthe other enterprise is an associated enterprise. In the context of GST, associated\nenterprise is particularly relevant in the case of supply of services, where the\nsupplier is located outside India. In such cases, the time of supply will be the\nearlier of date of entry in the books of account of the recipient of supply or the\ndate of payment - thus, within \u2018associated enterprises\u2019, the levy under GST is\nattracted once such book entries are made even if no actual payment takes place\nor no invoice is issued.\nQuestion 20: What would be the tax liability on replacement of parts (no\nconsideration is charged from a customer) under a warranty and whether the\nsupplier is required to reverse the input tax credit?\nAnswer: As parts are provided to the customer without a consideration under\nwarranty, no GST is chargeable on such replacement. The value of supply made\nearlier includes the charges to be incurred during the warranty period. Therefore,\nthe supplier who has undertaken the warranty replacement is not required to\nreverse the input tax credit on the parts/components replaced.\nQuestion 21: An Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) has an obligation\nto provide repair services to their customers in the warranty period. This\nactivity is outsourced by OEM to \u2018D\u2019, who bills the OEM for the services he\nprovides to the customer. What is the tax liability of \u2018D\u2019?\nAnswer: \u2018D\u2019 is providing service to the OEM. GST is payable on the value\nof any supplies made by \u2018D\u2019 to OEM i.e. in respect of bills raised by \u2018D\u2019 on the\nOEM.\nQuestion 22: How will the defective parts be sent to the mother warehouse/\nrepairing centre for repair by the downstream repairing centres? What is the\ntax liability?\nAnswer: The defective parts shall be sent for repair on a delivery challan\naccompanied by such e-way bill as may be prescribed. GST shall be chargeable\non the repair amount, including the cost of parts, charged by the repairing centre.\nQuestion 23: What is the tax liability in a scenario where supplies are made\nfrom multiple locations (in different States) of the supplier to the recipient\nunder a single contract?\nAnswer: Delivering services from various locations and integrated pricing\nfor the contract as a whole is the norm in IT/ITES industry. Normally the\ncontract or agreement with the recipient is entered into by one of the branches\n(let us say \u201cMain Branch\u201d). Therefore, in such cases of service delivery from\nmultiple locations of the supplier to the recipient, the supply could be visualized\nas consisting of two distinct supplies. First supply - the different branches of the\nsupplier located across different States are making the supply to the main branch\nwhich entered into a contact or an agreement with the recipient for the supply of\nsuch service. Second supply - main branch is making a supply to the customer.\nGST is to be levied accordingly. In such a scenario, the main branch would get\ninput tax credit of GST paid by the other branches on supplies made by them to\nthe main branch.\nQuestion 24: In the scenario envisaged in previous question, the main branch\nis said to be entitled to ITC of the GST paid by the other branches. Thus, it is a\nrevenue neutral situation. What are the valuation guidelines for such services?\nAnswer: The second proviso to rule 28 of the CGST Rules, 2017 provides\nthat where the recipient is eligible for full input tax credit, the value declared in\nthe invoice shall be deemed to be the open market value of goods and services.\nQuestion 25: Can payment of IGST on reverse charge basis on import of\ngoods/services be done through book entry or ITC?\nAnswer: No. GST payable on reverse charge basis is to be discharged\nthrough cash only. Rule 85(4) of the CGST Rules, 2017 refers.\nQuestion 26: Is the requirement of transferring of credit through ISD\nmechanism mandatory?\nAnswer: The ISD provision under the CGST Act, 2017 is not mandatory. It\nonly provides the manner of distribution of ITC wherever the business entity\nwishes to distribute the ITC as an Input Service Distributor.\nQuestion 27: What is the format for invoices to be issued in the case of reverse\ncharge payment of GST?\n\nAnswer: No separate format for any type of invoicing including self-\ninvoicing has been prescribed. The contents of the invoice have been prescribed\n\nin Rule 46 of the CGST Rules, 2017.\nQuestion 28: I am a software provider, registered at Mumbai. I supply software\nto my clients in Bangalore - would I be required to take a registration in\nKarnataka?\nAnswer: No. The supplies would be treated as inter-State supplies and IGST\nis chargeable on the same.\nQuestion 29: I am an exporter of services. Would I be entitled to refund after\nthe 1st of July (appointed day)?\nAnswer: For exports upto 30th June, 2017 refund may be claimed under the\nprovisions of the Chapter V of the Finance Act, 1994. Exports made on and after\n1st July would be eligible for refund under the GST law.\nNote: Reference to CGST Act, 2017 includes reference to SGST Act,\n2017 and UTGST Act, 2017 also.\n[Source: C.B.E. & C. website, dated 18-8-2017]\n11.

This requires careful attention in procedural issues such as invoicing, time of supply, place of supply, and ITC credit management to ensure compliance and avoid disputes.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFor the sale or transfer of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR):\n\n- **Permanent Transfer**:\n - **General Goods**: Tax rate of 12% (6% CGST + 6% SGST/IGST)\n - **IT Software**: Tax rate of 18% (9% CGST + 9% SGST/IGST)\n\n- **Temporary Transfer (Licensing)**:\n - **General Goods**: Tax rate of 12% (6% CGST + 6% SGST)\n - **IT Software**: Tax rate of 18% (9% CGST + 9% SGST)\n\nThis classification must be carefully handled to ensure correct application of taxes and compliance with GST requirements, as dual classification presents potential challenges and necessitates clear procedural adherence.\n\nIf any additional specific details or scenarios are required, these must be addressed with further specific context or clarifications from relevant GST notifications and rulings."}
{"input": [{"role": "system", "content": "As an expert legal consultant, provide a detailed response to the question below, considering the given context: 1. Meaning of Intellectual Property Right\nIntellectual Property Right (IPR) is not a new concept in the modern world.\nIntellectual Property Rights are set of rights associated with creations of the\nhuman mind that spontaneously emerges from application of intellect, which may\nbe in the form of an invention, design, trademark, formula, product process,\ntechnology, book, goodwill etc. So an output of the human mind may contribute\nto creation of intellectual property rights. Intellectual property has been\nrecognized as a very important asset for any business in the present scenario of\nworld economy. Intellectual property rights are protected by statutory laws.\n2. Protection of Intellectual Property Rights\nIn India Government has made legislation for the protection of Intellectual\nProperty Rights namely, Patents Act, Copyright Act. Trademarks Act and\nDesigns Act. With regard to protection of Intellectual property rights in other\ncountries, they follow the international legal instruments. The establishment of\nthe World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) is an important milestone\nin the history of human-kind that recognizes the legitimate rights of the creator of\nthe work and protects him against unfair competition.\n3. Taxable event under GST\n\u201cSupply\u201d is the taxable event under GST, in place of \u201ctaxable goods \u201cand\n\u201ctaxable services\u201d as was prevailed in the earlier tax laws for the purpose of levy\nof tax. Section 2(108) of the CGST Act, defines \u201cTaxable supply\u201d means a\nsupply of goods or services or both which is leviable to tax under GST. Thus,\nGST is levied upon the \u201csupplies of goods and services\u201d. Section 9(1) of the CGST Act, states that tax shall be levied on the transaction value of a supply of\ngoods or services or both.\n4. Definition of \u201cGoods\u201d\nSection 2(52) of the CGST Act, \u201cgoods\u201d means every kind of movable\nproperty other than money and securities but includes actionable claim, growing\ncrops, grass and things attached to or forming part of the land which are agreed to\nbe severed before supply or under a contract of supply;\n5. Definition of \u201cServices\u201d\nSection 2(102) of the CGST Act, \u201cservices\u201d means anything other than\ngoods, money and securities but includes activities relating to the use of money\nor its conversion by cash or by any other mode, from one form, currency or\ndenomination, to another form, currency or denomination for which a separate\nconsideration is charged;\n6. Intellectual Property Rights under GST\nEven though, Intellectual Property Rights has not been defined under CGST\nAct; by plain reading of the definition of \u201cgoods\u201d it is clear that Intellectual\nProperty Rights qualifies as goods. Further, section 5(c) of schedule II of the\nCGST Act, specified that \u201ctemporary transfer or permitting the use or enjoyment\nof any intellectual property right to be considered as supply of services.\nAccordingly, the Central Government, on the recommendations of the GST\nCouncil, have notified the taxable rates of \u201cIntellectual property rights \u201cboth\nunder classification of goods as well as classification of services.\n7. Classification & rate of Services of IPR\nWhile notifying the taxable rates of services vide Notification No. 11/2017\n(Rate), dated 28-6-2017 has classified Intellectual Property Rights at Sl. No. 17\nare reproduced as under:\nS.\nNo.\nChapter/Section/\nHeading\n\nDescription of Service Rate of Tax\n@\n\n17 Heading 9973\n(Leasing or rental\nservices, with or\nwithout operator)\n\n(i) Temporary or Permanent transfer\nor permitting the use or enjoyment\nof Intellectual Property (IP) right\nin respect of goods other than\nInformation Technology software.\n12%\n(6% CGST +\n6% SGST)\n\n(ii) Temporary or permanent transfer\nor permitting the use or enjoyment\nof Intellectual Property (IP) right\nin respect of Information\nTechnology Software.\n\n18%\n(9% CGST +\n9% SGST)\n\nThe scheme of \u201cclassification of services\u201d for the Heading 9973 only\nprovides for licensing services (temporary transfer) for right to use the IPR.\nGenerally, the End User Licence Agreement is the legal contract between a\nsoftware application author or publisher and the user of that application\ngoverning the usage. The agreement is renewable and/or could be amended from\ntime to time. To find out as to whether there is an element of supply involved\nwhen software is delivered to its customer; the terms and conditions of End User\nLicence Agreement are material. The contract for supply therefore assumes\nsignificant in this test to decide whether or not there has been \u2018temporary transfer\nor permitting the use or enjoyment of any intellectual property right.\nThus temporary/permanent transfer a particular intellectual property right\nwould be considered as supply of service and 12% tax would be levied on the\ntransaction value provided such IPR is not in respect of software. The\nsale/licensing of intellectual property right pertaining to software would be\ncharged 18% tax.\nIt is pertinent to mention that the Constitutional amendment Act, 2016 did\nnot amend Article 366(29A)(d) which specifies that the transfer of the right to\nuse any goods is to be deemed as a sale of those goods. Further, once IPR is\ntreated as goods, a permanent transfer of such IPR would amount to a sale of\ngoods; will be the same as to a supply of goods. However, the Central\nGovernment while notifying the tax rate of services has classified the transfer of\nthe right to use any goods to be treated as service.\n8. Classification & rate of goods of IPR\nWhile taxable rates of goods were notified vide Notification No. 1/2017-C.T.\n(Rate), dated 28-6-2017, unfortunately this notification did not contains any\nspecific entry or rates for taxing Intellectual Property Rights as goods.\nSubsequently, as per the recommendations made by the GST Council meeting\nheld on 10th November, 2017, rates of Intellectual property rights has been\ninserted at Sl. No. 243 of amended Notification No. 41/2017-C.T. (Rate), dated\n14-11-2017, which is reproduced as under:\nS.\nNo.\nChapter/Heading/\nSub-heading/\nTariff item\n\nDescription of Goods Rate of\nTax @\n\n243 Any Chapter Permanent transfer of Intellectual\nProperty (IP) right in respect of\ngoods other than Information\nTechnology software.\n\n12%\n(6% CGST +\n6% SGST)\nThe above classification of goods and tax rates relating to permanent transfer\nof Intellectual Property right in respect of goods other than IT software will\nattract tax @ 12%, which is equal to service classification notification. It is\npertinent to mention that when the rate of \u201cIntellectual property rights \u201chas been\ninserted under goods notification, corresponding deletion has not been done to\nthe service notification. This amendment has given a confirmation that\npermanent transfer of intellectual property rights would be taxed as supply of\ngoods where as temporary transfer of intellectual property rights would be taxed\nas supply of services. This dual classification of tax rates would create unnecessary procedural problems, relating to time of supply, place of supply,\ninvoicing, accounting of ITC credit and proper availment of ITC credit.\n9. Tax Rates of IGST for Goods\nFurther, the Central Government on the recommendations of the GST\nCouncil has notified the tax rates of integrated tax for goods vide Notification\nNo. 1/2017-I.T., dated 28-6-2017 and shall be\nCharged in respect of inter-State supplies of goods as under:\n(i) 5% in respect of goods specified in Schedule-I.\n(ii) 12% in respect of goods specified in Schedule-II.\n(iii) 18% in respect of goods specified in Schedule-III.\n(iv) 28% in respect of goods specified in Schedule-IV.\n(v) 3% in respect of goods specified in Schedule V and\n(vi) 25% in respect of goods specified in Schedule-VI.\nThe details of schedules with chapter heading has been annexed to the said\nNotification, the tax shall be levied on inter-State supplies of goods, the\ndescription of which is specified in the corresponding entry in column (3) of the\nsaid schedules, falling under the Heading/sub-heading/Tariff item or chapter, as\nthe case may be, as specified in the corresponding entry in column (2) of the said\nSchedules. The chapter heading/sub-heading which is specified in the First\nSchedule to the Customs Tariff Act, 1975. In order to tax goods both column 2\nand column 3 have to read conjunctively.\nOn perusal of all schedules and chapter headings annexed to the said\nNotification, unfortunately there is no chapter covering of IPR under the Customs\nTariff Act, 1975. The Central Government as well as GST Council has failed to\n\ntake note of the same to declare tax rates for IPR to be charged tax rate for inter-\nState supplies of IPR.\n\nLater, the Central Government with recommendation of GST Council has\nbrought amendment to the said tax rates vide Notification No. 43/2017-I.T.\n(Rate), dated 14-11-2017, which is extracted as under:\nS.\nNo.\nChapter/\nHeading/\nsub-heading/\nTariff item\n\nDescription of Goods Rate of Tax @\n\n243 Any Chapter Permanent transfer of Intellectual\nProperty (IP) right in respect of goods\nother than Information Technology\nsoftware.\n\n12%\n(6% CGST +\n6% IGST)\nThe above table is showing tax rate has been inserted vide said Notification\ndated 14th November, 2017 for IPR, wherein it is specified that a permanent\ntransfer of Intellectual Property Right (IPR) is to be taxed @12% (6% CGST +\n6% IGST) (in Schedule II) for inter-State supplies. It is pertinent to mention there are no chapter heading/tariff heading of Customs rather it has been mentioned as\n\u201cany chapter\u201d then is it proper to charge IGST without any chapter heading or\nsub-heading of Customs. It may be questioned by the taxpayers whether to pay\nIGST or not in the absence of chapter heading.\nThe tax rate for services under Heading 9973 as classified under GST will\ncreate confusion as well as litigation. There is need of proper classification of\nIPR/tax rates of CGST, SGST & IGST for goods. It is pertinent to mention that\nthere is no rate of tax on IPR as goods during the period 1st July\u20192017 to 13th\nNovember\u20192017. The Central Government as well as GST Council even though\nhas notified tax rate of IPR as goods by inserting necessary entry in CGST rate\nand IGST rate but both the Notifications have been declared as prospective.\nSince the imposition of rate is not retrospective to cover the tax rate period from\n1st July\u20192017 to 13th November\u20192017, demands raised on permanent transfer of\nIPR will create litigations in the coming days.\nThus, It is observed that, under GST is the dual Classification of rate of tax\non IPR needs to be reviewed by the GST Council and necessary clarification may\nbe issued for smooth tax collection and reduction of probable litigation on\naccount of interpretation of taxability on IPR in the coming days.\n10. FAQ for GST on IT/ITES\nQuestion 1: Whether software is regarded as goods or services in GST?\nAnswer: In terms of Schedule II of the CGST Act, 2017, development,\ndesign, programming, customisation, adaptation, upgradation, enhancement,\nimplementation of information technology software and temporary transfer or\npermitting the use or enjoyment of any intellectual property right are treated as\nservices.\nBut, if a pre-developed or pre-designed software is supplied in any medium/\nstorage (commonly bought off-the-shelf) or made available through the use of\nencryption keys, the same is treated as a supply of goods classifiable under\nheading 8523.\nQuestion 2: What are the implications of recognising the development, design,\nprogramming, customisation, adaptation, upgradation, enhancement, and\nimplementation of information technology software as a service?\nAnswer: The primary implication is that the place of supply rules applicable\nto services would apply in determining taxability of the supply of software\nservices. The same would be applicable in situations of supply of services\ninvolving a temporary transfer or permitting the use or enjoyment of any\nintellectual property right. The other implication is that the supplier of software\nservices would not be eligible for the composition scheme.\nQuestion 3: \u2018A\u2019 is a dealer in Computers and Computer parts having turnover\nof Rs. 8 lakh in a year; does \u2018A\u2019 have to register under GST?\nAnswer: Every supplier located in a State or Union territory, whose\n\u201caggregate turnover\u201d in a financial year exceeds twenty lakh rupees, is liable to\nbe registered under GST. This limit of turnover for a special category State is ten lakh rupees. \u2018A\u2019, whose aggregate turnover is only Rs. 8 lakh in a year, is\ntherefore not liable to registration.\nQuestion 4: The registered person \u2018B\u2019 receives small portions of software code\nfrom individuals which he then integrates and supply as a package to clients.\nThese individuals are having small turnover of Rs. 5 to 10 lakh, and therefore\nare not registered in GST. Whether there is any liability on \u2018B\u2019 in respect of\nservices provided by such individuals?\nAnswer: If the supplies are made by unregistered suppliers, GST is liable to\nbe paid by the recipient, who is a registered person, under section 9(4) of the\nCGST Act, 2017. Therefore, in this case \u2018B\u2019 is liable to pay GST on services\nprovided by these individuals. \u2018B\u2019 can claim credit of this tax paid by him on\nreverse charge.\nQuestion 5: What is the rate of tax on IT services?\nAnswer: The rate of GST on IT services is 18%.\nQuestion 6: Whether exports of software services attract GST?\n\nAnswer: Exports and supplies to SEZ units and SEZ developers are zero-\nrated in GST. Zero-rating effectively means that no tax is payable on exports but\n\nthe exporter/supplier is entitled to the input tax credit on inputs/input services\nused in relation to exports. The exporters have two options for zero rating, which\nare as follows:\n(1) To pay integrated tax on supplies meant to be exported and get refund of\ntax so paid after the supply is exported.\n(2) To make export supplies under a bond or letter of undertaking and claim\nrefund of taxes suffered on inputs and input services in relation to such\nexports.\nQuestion 7: How do I determine whether IT services provided by me constitute\nexport of service?\nAnswer: The supply of any service is considered an export of service, where\nthe following conditions are met:\n(1) the supplier of service is located in India;\n(2) the recipient of service is located outside India;\n(3) the place of supply of service is outside India;\n(4) the payment for such service has been received by the supplier of service\nin convertible foreign exchange; and\n(5) the supplier of service and the recipient of service are not merely\nestablishments of a distinct person in accordance with explanation 1 of\nsection 8 of the IGST Act, 2017.\nQuestion 8: How do I determine the place of supply of IT/ITES services?\nAnswer: Place of supply of IT/ITES services is the location of the recipient\nin terms of section 12 and 13 of the IGST Act, 2017. However, if the recipient is not registered and his address is not available on the records of the supplier, the\nplace of supply would be the location of the supplier.\nQuestion 9: How to determine the location of the recipient?\nAnswer: Location of the recipient of service is defined in section 2(14) of\nthe IGST Act. A recipient of services is treated as located outside India if his\nplace of business where he receives services is outside India or, if he does not\nhave a place of business, his usual place of residence is outside India.\nQuestion 10: Would I be liable to pay GST on reverse charge even if the\nforeign supplier of software from whom I buy for use in my firm registered\nunder GST was to accept the payment in Indian Rupees?\nAnswer: Yes, you would be liable to pay GST. A supply is treated as an\nimport of service if the following conditions are satisfied:\n(1) the supplier of service is located outside India;\n(2) the recipient of service is located in India; and\n(3) the place of supply of service is in India.\nThe place of such supply would be taken to be the location where the firm is\nregistered (in GST) and the supplies would attract integrated tax (IGST). The\nfactum of which currency was used to pay the consideration is immaterial.\nQuestion 11: I am an Indian Company who makes software and sells it outside\nthe country. I have hired a firm (not a related party) \u2018C\u2019 located abroad to\nfacilitate the supply of software in Europe and the USA; would I be liable to\npay GST on the payments that I make to this entity abroad?\nAnswer: No. In this case, \u2018C\u2019 is covered by the definition of \u2018intermediary\u2019\n[section 2(13) of the IGST Act, 2017]. The place of supply of such intermediary\nservice is location of the supplier in terms of section 13(8) of the IGST Act,\n2017. As \u2018C\u2019 is located outside India, GST is not payable in this case.\nQuestion 12: What factors determine the location of \u2018C\u2019 (in question 11) as\nbeing outside India?\nAnswer: In terms of section 2(15) of the IGST Act, 2017, the location of a\nservice provider is to be determined by applying the following steps sequentially:\n(1) where a supply is made from a place of business for which the\nregistration has been obtained, the location of such place of business;\n(2) where a supply is made from a place other than the place of business for\nwhich registration has been obtained (a fixed establishment elsewhere),\nthe location of such fixed establishment;\n(3) where a supply is made from more than one establishment, whether the\nplace of business or fixed establishment, the location of the\nestablishment most directly concerned with the provision of the supply;\nand\n(4) in absence of such places, the location of the usual place of residence of\nthe supplier. The location of \u2018C\u2019 is to be determined by applying the criterion from (2), or\n(3), or as the case may be, (4).\nQuestion 13: I am an agent in India of a foreign IT/ITES provider (principal\nlocated outside India). For agency services, I bill the principal in convertible\nforeign exchange. Whether GST liability arises in this case?\nAnswer: You are an intermediary and the place of supply of the service\nprovided by you to the principal is in India irrespective of the mode of payment.\nHence, GST is payable on the services provided by you as an intermediary to the\nprincipal.\nQuestion 14: I have more than one SEZ unit in different States; do I need to\ntake separate registrations? Also, I have two SEZ units in one State. Can I take\na single registration?\nAnswer: (1) Yes. Under GST, every entity shall take GST registration in\neach State from which it makes taxable supplies. However, a single registration\ncan be taken for all your SEZ units within a State, whether located in one SEZ or\nmore than one SEZ.\n(2) A person having unit(s) in a Special Economic Zone as well as outside\nthe SEZ in a State shall make a separate application for registration for SEZ\nunit(s) as a business vertical distinct from his other units located outside the\nSpecial Economic Zone in that State (Refer Rule 8(1) of CGST Rules, 2017).\nQuestion 15: I have a unit in the DTA and another in the SEZ; can I take a\ncommon registration?\nAnswer: No. A person having unit(s) in a Special Economic Zone as well as\noutside the SEZ in a State, shall make a separate application for registration for\nSEZ unit(s) as a business vertical distinct from his other units located outside the\nSpecial Economic Zone in that State (Refer Rule 8(1) of CGST Rules, 2017).\nQuestion 16: If I supply a laptop bag along with the laptop to my customer,\nwhat would be the rate of tax leviable?\nAnswer: If the laptop bag is supplied along with the laptop in the ordinary\ncourse of business, the principal supply is that of the laptop and the bag is an\nancillary. Therefore, it is a composite supply and the rate of tax would that as\napplicable to the laptop.\nQuestion 17: I am obtaining online database access services from a company\nabroad over the net, would I have to pay tax on reverse charge?\nAnswer: The recipient, if registered, has to pay the applicable IGST on\nreverse charge basis. If the recipient is not registered, the matter is treated as an\nonline information and database access or retrieval service (OIDAR) and the\nOIDAR service provider is liable to take registration and pay tax.\nQuestion 18: When would it be construed that I have made a supply of services\ninvolving temporary transfer or permitting the use or enjoyment of any\nintellectual property right?\nAnswer: Generally, the End User Licence Agreement (EULA) is the legal\ncontract between a software application author or publisher and the user of that\napplication governing the usage. The agreement is renewable and/or could be\namended from time to time. To find out as to whether there is an element of\nsupply involved when software is delivered to its customer, the terms and\nconditions of EULA are material.\nThe contract for supply therefore assumes significance in this test to decide\nwhether or not there has been \u2018temporary transfer or permitting the use or\nenjoyment of any intellectual property right\u2019.\nQuestion 19: What special provisions are attracted in GST with regard to\nassociated enterprises?\nAnswer: An enterprise which participates, either directly or indirectly,\nthrough one or more intermediaries, in the management, or control or capital of\nthe other enterprise is an associated enterprise. In the context of GST, associated\nenterprise is particularly relevant in the case of supply of services, where the\nsupplier is located outside India. In such cases, the time of supply will be the\nearlier of date of entry in the books of account of the recipient of supply or the\ndate of payment - thus, within \u2018associated enterprises\u2019, the levy under GST is\nattracted once such book entries are made even if no actual payment takes place\nor no invoice is issued.\nQuestion 20: What would be the tax liability on replacement of parts (no\nconsideration is charged from a customer) under a warranty and whether the\nsupplier is required to reverse the input tax credit?\nAnswer: As parts are provided to the customer without a consideration under\nwarranty, no GST is chargeable on such replacement. The value of supply made\nearlier includes the charges to be incurred during the warranty period. Therefore,\nthe supplier who has undertaken the warranty replacement is not required to\nreverse the input tax credit on the parts/components replaced.\nQuestion 21: An Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) has an obligation\nto provide repair services to their customers in the warranty period. This\nactivity is outsourced by OEM to \u2018D\u2019, who bills the OEM for the services he\nprovides to the customer. What is the tax liability of \u2018D\u2019?\nAnswer: \u2018D\u2019 is providing service to the OEM. GST is payable on the value\nof any supplies made by \u2018D\u2019 to OEM i.e. in respect of bills raised by \u2018D\u2019 on the\nOEM.\nQuestion 22: How will the defective parts be sent to the mother warehouse/\nrepairing centre for repair by the downstream repairing centres? What is the\ntax liability?\nAnswer: The defective parts shall be sent for repair on a delivery challan\naccompanied by such e-way bill as may be prescribed. GST shall be chargeable\non the repair amount, including the cost of parts, charged by the repairing centre.\nQuestion 23: What is the tax liability in a scenario where supplies are made\nfrom multiple locations (in different States) of the supplier to the recipient\nunder a single contract?\nAnswer: Delivering services from various locations and integrated pricing\nfor the contract as a whole is the norm in IT/ITES industry. Normally the\ncontract or agreement with the recipient is entered into by one of the branches\n(let us say \u201cMain Branch\u201d). Therefore, in such cases of service delivery from\nmultiple locations of the supplier to the recipient, the supply could be visualized\nas consisting of two distinct supplies. First supply - the different branches of the\nsupplier located across different States are making the supply to the main branch\nwhich entered into a contact or an agreement with the recipient for the supply of\nsuch service. Second supply - main branch is making a supply to the customer.\nGST is to be levied accordingly. In such a scenario, the main branch would get\ninput tax credit of GST paid by the other branches on supplies made by them to\nthe main branch.\nQuestion 24: In the scenario envisaged in previous question, the main branch\nis said to be entitled to ITC of the GST paid by the other branches. Thus, it is a\nrevenue neutral situation. What are the valuation guidelines for such services?\nAnswer: The second proviso to rule 28 of the CGST Rules, 2017 provides\nthat where the recipient is eligible for full input tax credit, the value declared in\nthe invoice shall be deemed to be the open market value of goods and services.\nQuestion 25: Can payment of IGST on reverse charge basis on import of\ngoods/services be done through book entry or ITC?\nAnswer: No. GST payable on reverse charge basis is to be discharged\nthrough cash only. Rule 85(4) of the CGST Rules, 2017 refers.\nQuestion 26: Is the requirement of transferring of credit through ISD\nmechanism mandatory?\nAnswer: The ISD provision under the CGST Act, 2017 is not mandatory. It\nonly provides the manner of distribution of ITC wherever the business entity\nwishes to distribute the ITC as an Input Service Distributor.\nQuestion 27: What is the format for invoices to be issued in the case of reverse\ncharge payment of GST?\n\nAnswer: No separate format for any type of invoicing including self-\ninvoicing has been prescribed. The contents of the invoice have been prescribed\n\nin Rule 46 of the CGST Rules, 2017.\nQuestion 28: I am a software provider, registered at Mumbai. I supply software\nto my clients in Bangalore - would I be required to take a registration in\nKarnataka?\nAnswer: No. The supplies would be treated as inter-State supplies and IGST\nis chargeable on the same.\nQuestion 29: I am an exporter of services. Would I be entitled to refund after\nthe 1st of July (appointed day)?\nAnswer: For exports upto 30th June, 2017 refund may be claimed under the\nprovisions of the Chapter V of the Finance Act, 1994. Exports made on and after\n1st July would be eligible for refund under the GST law.\nNote: Reference to CGST Act, 2017 includes reference to SGST Act,\n2017 and UTGST Act, 2017 also.\n[Source: C.B.E. & C. website, dated 18-8-2017]\n11.

This requires careful attention in procedural issues such as invoicing, time of supply, place of supply, and ITC credit management to ensure compliance and avoid disputes.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFor the sale or transfer of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR):\n\n- **Permanent Transfer**:\n - **General Goods**: Tax rate of 12% (6% CGST + 6% SGST/IGST)\n - **IT Software**: Tax rate of 18% (9% CGST + 9% SGST/IGST)\n\n- **Temporary Transfer (Licensing)**:\n - **General Goods**: Tax rate of 12% (6% CGST + 6% SGST)\n - **IT Software**: Tax rate of 18% (9% CGST + 9% SGST)\n\nThis classification must be carefully handled to ensure correct application of taxes and compliance with GST requirements, as dual classification presents potential challenges and necessitates clear procedural adherence.\n\nIf any additional specific details or scenarios are required, these must be addressed with further specific context or clarifications from relevant GST notifications and rulings."}
{"input": [{"role": "system", "content": "As an expert legal consultant, provide a detailed response to the question below, considering the given context: 1. Meaning of Intellectual Property Right\nIntellectual Property Right (IPR) is not a new concept in the modern world.\nIntellectual Property Rights are set of rights associated with creations of the\nhuman mind that spontaneously emerges from application of intellect, which may\nbe in the form of an invention, design, trademark, formula, product process,\ntechnology, book, goodwill etc. So an output of the human mind may contribute\nto creation of intellectual property rights. Intellectual property has been\nrecognized as a very important asset for any business in the present scenario of\nworld economy. Intellectual property rights are protected by statutory laws.\n2. Protection of Intellectual Property Rights\nIn India Government has made legislation for the protection of Intellectual\nProperty Rights namely, Patents Act, Copyright Act. Trademarks Act and\nDesigns Act. With regard to protection of Intellectual property rights in other\ncountries, they follow the international legal instruments. The establishment of\nthe World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) is an important milestone\nin the history of human-kind that recognizes the legitimate rights of the creator of\nthe work and protects him against unfair competition.\n3. Taxable event under GST\n\u201cSupply\u201d is the taxable event under GST, in place of \u201ctaxable goods \u201cand\n\u201ctaxable services\u201d as was prevailed in the earlier tax laws for the purpose of levy\nof tax. Section 2(108) of the CGST Act, defines \u201cTaxable supply\u201d means a\nsupply of goods or services or both which is leviable to tax under GST. Thus,\nGST is levied upon the \u201csupplies of goods and services\u201d. Section 9(1) of the CGST Act, states that tax shall be levied on the transaction value of a supply of\ngoods or services or both.\n4. Definition of \u201cGoods\u201d\nSection 2(52) of the CGST Act, \u201cgoods\u201d means every kind of movable\nproperty other than money and securities but includes actionable claim, growing\ncrops, grass and things attached to or forming part of the land which are agreed to\nbe severed before supply or under a contract of supply;\n5. Definition of \u201cServices\u201d\nSection 2(102) of the CGST Act, \u201cservices\u201d means anything other than\ngoods, money and securities but includes activities relating to the use of money\nor its conversion by cash or by any other mode, from one form, currency or\ndenomination, to another form, currency or denomination for which a separate\nconsideration is charged;\n6. Intellectual Property Rights under GST\nEven though, Intellectual Property Rights has not been defined under CGST\nAct; by plain reading of the definition of \u201cgoods\u201d it is clear that Intellectual\nProperty Rights qualifies as goods. Further, section 5(c) of schedule II of the\nCGST Act, specified that \u201ctemporary transfer or permitting the use or enjoyment\nof any intellectual property right to be considered as supply of services.\nAccordingly, the Central Government, on the recommendations of the GST\nCouncil, have notified the taxable rates of \u201cIntellectual property rights \u201cboth\nunder classification of goods as well as classification of services.\n7. Classification & rate of Services of IPR\nWhile notifying the taxable rates of services vide Notification No. 11/2017\n(Rate), dated 28-6-2017 has classified Intellectual Property Rights at Sl. No. 17\nare reproduced as under:\nS.\nNo.\nChapter/Section/\nHeading\n\nDescription of Service Rate of Tax\n@\n\n17 Heading 9973\n(Leasing or rental\nservices, with or\nwithout operator)\n\n(i) Temporary or Permanent transfer\nor permitting the use or enjoyment\nof Intellectual Property (IP) right\nin respect of goods other than\nInformation Technology software.\n12%\n(6% CGST +\n6% SGST)\n\n(ii) Temporary or permanent transfer\nor permitting the use or enjoyment\nof Intellectual Property (IP) right\nin respect of Information\nTechnology Software.\n\n18%\n(9% CGST +\n9% SGST)\n\nThe scheme of \u201cclassification of services\u201d for the Heading 9973 only\nprovides for licensing services (temporary transfer) for right to use the IPR.\nGenerally, the End User Licence Agreement is the legal contract between a\nsoftware application author or publisher and the user of that application\ngoverning the usage. The agreement is renewable and/or could be amended from\ntime to time. To find out as to whether there is an element of supply involved\nwhen software is delivered to its customer; the terms and conditions of End User\nLicence Agreement are material. The contract for supply therefore assumes\nsignificant in this test to decide whether or not there has been \u2018temporary transfer\nor permitting the use or enjoyment of any intellectual property right.\nThus temporary/permanent transfer a particular intellectual property right\nwould be considered as supply of service and 12% tax would be levied on the\ntransaction value provided such IPR is not in respect of software. The\nsale/licensing of intellectual property right pertaining to software would be\ncharged 18% tax.\nIt is pertinent to mention that the Constitutional amendment Act, 2016 did\nnot amend Article 366(29A)(d) which specifies that the transfer of the right to\nuse any goods is to be deemed as a sale of those goods. Further, once IPR is\ntreated as goods, a permanent transfer of such IPR would amount to a sale of\ngoods; will be the same as to a supply of goods. However, the Central\nGovernment while notifying the tax rate of services has classified the transfer of\nthe right to use any goods to be treated as service.\n8. Classification & rate of goods of IPR\nWhile taxable rates of goods were notified vide Notification No. 1/2017-C.T.\n(Rate), dated 28-6-2017, unfortunately this notification did not contains any\nspecific entry or rates for taxing Intellectual Property Rights as goods.\nSubsequently, as per the recommendations made by the GST Council meeting\nheld on 10th November, 2017, rates of Intellectual property rights has been\ninserted at Sl. No. 243 of amended Notification No. 41/2017-C.T. (Rate), dated\n14-11-2017, which is reproduced as under:\nS.\nNo.\nChapter/Heading/\nSub-heading/\nTariff item\n\nDescription of Goods Rate of\nTax @\n\n243 Any Chapter Permanent transfer of Intellectual\nProperty (IP) right in respect of\ngoods other than Information\nTechnology software.\n\n12%\n(6% CGST +\n6% SGST)\nThe above classification of goods and tax rates relating to permanent transfer\nof Intellectual Property right in respect of goods other than IT software will\nattract tax @ 12%, which is equal to service classification notification. It is\npertinent to mention that when the rate of \u201cIntellectual property rights \u201chas been\ninserted under goods notification, corresponding deletion has not been done to\nthe service notification. This amendment has given a confirmation that\npermanent transfer of intellectual property rights would be taxed as supply of\ngoods where as temporary transfer of intellectual property rights would be taxed\nas supply of services. This dual classification of tax rates would create unnecessary procedural problems, relating to time of supply, place of supply,\ninvoicing, accounting of ITC credit and proper availment of ITC credit.\n9. Tax Rates of IGST for Goods\nFurther, the Central Government on the recommendations of the GST\nCouncil has notified the tax rates of integrated tax for goods vide Notification\nNo. 1/2017-I.T., dated 28-6-2017 and shall be\nCharged in respect of inter-State supplies of goods as under:\n(i) 5% in respect of goods specified in Schedule-I.\n(ii) 12% in respect of goods specified in Schedule-II.\n(iii) 18% in respect of goods specified in Schedule-III.\n(iv) 28% in respect of goods specified in Schedule-IV.\n(v) 3% in respect of goods specified in Schedule V and\n(vi) 25% in respect of goods specified in Schedule-VI.\nThe details of schedules with chapter heading has been annexed to the said\nNotification, the tax shall be levied on inter-State supplies of goods, the\ndescription of which is specified in the corresponding entry in column (3) of the\nsaid schedules, falling under the Heading/sub-heading/Tariff item or chapter, as\nthe case may be, as specified in the corresponding entry in column (2) of the said\nSchedules. The chapter heading/sub-heading which is specified in the First\nSchedule to the Customs Tariff Act, 1975. In order to tax goods both column 2\nand column 3 have to read conjunctively.\nOn perusal of all schedules and chapter headings annexed to the said\nNotification, unfortunately there is no chapter covering of IPR under the Customs\nTariff Act, 1975. The Central Government as well as GST Council has failed to\n\ntake note of the same to declare tax rates for IPR to be charged tax rate for inter-\nState supplies of IPR.\n\nLater, the Central Government with recommendation of GST Council has\nbrought amendment to the said tax rates vide Notification No. 43/2017-I.T.\n(Rate), dated 14-11-2017, which is extracted as under:\nS.\nNo.\nChapter/\nHeading/\nsub-heading/\nTariff item\n\nDescription of Goods Rate of Tax @\n\n243 Any Chapter Permanent transfer of Intellectual\nProperty (IP) right in respect of goods\nother than Information Technology\nsoftware.\n\n12%\n(6% CGST +\n6% IGST)\nThe above table is showing tax rate has been inserted vide said Notification\ndated 14th November, 2017 for IPR, wherein it is specified that a permanent\ntransfer of Intellectual Property Right (IPR) is to be taxed @12% (6% CGST +\n6% IGST) (in Schedule II) for inter-State supplies. It is pertinent to mention there are no chapter heading/tariff heading of Customs rather it has been mentioned as\n\u201cany chapter\u201d then is it proper to charge IGST without any chapter heading or\nsub-heading of Customs. It may be questioned by the taxpayers whether to pay\nIGST or not in the absence of chapter heading.\nThe tax rate for services under Heading 9973 as classified under GST will\ncreate confusion as well as litigation. There is need of proper classification of\nIPR/tax rates of CGST, SGST & IGST for goods. It is pertinent to mention that\nthere is no rate of tax on IPR as goods during the period 1st July\u20192017 to 13th\nNovember\u20192017. The Central Government as well as GST Council even though\nhas notified tax rate of IPR as goods by inserting necessary entry in CGST rate\nand IGST rate but both the Notifications have been declared as prospective.\nSince the imposition of rate is not retrospective to cover the tax rate period from\n1st July\u20192017 to 13th November\u20192017, demands raised on permanent transfer of\nIPR will create litigations in the coming days.\nThus, It is observed that, under GST is the dual Classification of rate of tax\non IPR needs to be reviewed by the GST Council and necessary clarification may\nbe issued for smooth tax collection and reduction of probable litigation on\naccount of interpretation of taxability on IPR in the coming days.\n10. FAQ for GST on IT/ITES\nQuestion 1: Whether software is regarded as goods or services in GST?\nAnswer: In terms of Schedule II of the CGST Act, 2017, development,\ndesign, programming, customisation, adaptation, upgradation, enhancement,\nimplementation of information technology software and temporary transfer or\npermitting the use or enjoyment of any intellectual property right are treated as\nservices.\nBut, if a pre-developed or pre-designed software is supplied in any medium/\nstorage (commonly bought off-the-shelf) or made available through the use of\nencryption keys, the same is treated as a supply of goods classifiable under\nheading 8523.\nQuestion 2: What are the implications of recognising the development, design,\nprogramming, customisation, adaptation, upgradation, enhancement, and\nimplementation of information technology software as a service?\nAnswer: The primary implication is that the place of supply rules applicable\nto services would apply in determining taxability of the supply of software\nservices. The same would be applicable in situations of supply of services\ninvolving a temporary transfer or permitting the use or enjoyment of any\nintellectual property right. The other implication is that the supplier of software\nservices would not be eligible for the composition scheme.\nQuestion 3: \u2018A\u2019 is a dealer in Computers and Computer parts having turnover\nof Rs. 8 lakh in a year; does \u2018A\u2019 have to register under GST?\nAnswer: Every supplier located in a State or Union territory, whose\n\u201caggregate turnover\u201d in a financial year exceeds twenty lakh rupees, is liable to\nbe registered under GST. This limit of turnover for a special category State is ten lakh rupees. \u2018A\u2019, whose aggregate turnover is only Rs. 8 lakh in a year, is\ntherefore not liable to registration.\nQuestion 4: The registered person \u2018B\u2019 receives small portions of software code\nfrom individuals which he then integrates and supply as a package to clients.\nThese individuals are having small turnover of Rs. 5 to 10 lakh, and therefore\nare not registered in GST. Whether there is any liability on \u2018B\u2019 in respect of\nservices provided by such individuals?\nAnswer: If the supplies are made by unregistered suppliers, GST is liable to\nbe paid by the recipient, who is a registered person, under section 9(4) of the\nCGST Act, 2017. Therefore, in this case \u2018B\u2019 is liable to pay GST on services\nprovided by these individuals. \u2018B\u2019 can claim credit of this tax paid by him on\nreverse charge.\nQuestion 5: What is the rate of tax on IT services?\nAnswer: The rate of GST on IT services is 18%.\nQuestion 6: Whether exports of software services attract GST?\n\nAnswer: Exports and supplies to SEZ units and SEZ developers are zero-\nrated in GST. Zero-rating effectively means that no tax is payable on exports but\n\nthe exporter/supplier is entitled to the input tax credit on inputs/input services\nused in relation to exports. The exporters have two options for zero rating, which\nare as follows:\n(1) To pay integrated tax on supplies meant to be exported and get refund of\ntax so paid after the supply is exported.\n(2) To make export supplies under a bond or letter of undertaking and claim\nrefund of taxes suffered on inputs and input services in relation to such\nexports.\nQuestion 7: How do I determine whether IT services provided by me constitute\nexport of service?\nAnswer: The supply of any service is considered an export of service, where\nthe following conditions are met:\n(1) the supplier of service is located in India;\n(2) the recipient of service is located outside India;\n(3) the place of supply of service is outside India;\n(4) the payment for such service has been received by the supplier of service\nin convertible foreign exchange; and\n(5) the supplier of service and the recipient of service are not merely\nestablishments of a distinct person in accordance with explanation 1 of\nsection 8 of the IGST Act, 2017.\nQuestion 8: How do I determine the place of supply of IT/ITES services?\nAnswer: Place of supply of IT/ITES services is the location of the recipient\nin terms of section 12 and 13 of the IGST Act, 2017. However, if the recipient is not registered and his address is not available on the records of the supplier, the\nplace of supply would be the location of the supplier.\nQuestion 9: How to determine the location of the recipient?\nAnswer: Location of the recipient of service is defined in section 2(14) of\nthe IGST Act. A recipient of services is treated as located outside India if his\nplace of business where he receives services is outside India or, if he does not\nhave a place of business, his usual place of residence is outside India.\nQuestion 10: Would I be liable to pay GST on reverse charge even if the\nforeign supplier of software from whom I buy for use in my firm registered\nunder GST was to accept the payment in Indian Rupees?\nAnswer: Yes, you would be liable to pay GST. A supply is treated as an\nimport of service if the following conditions are satisfied:\n(1) the supplier of service is located outside India;\n(2) the recipient of service is located in India; and\n(3) the place of supply of service is in India.\nThe place of such supply would be taken to be the location where the firm is\nregistered (in GST) and the supplies would attract integrated tax (IGST). The\nfactum of which currency was used to pay the consideration is immaterial.\nQuestion 11: I am an Indian Company who makes software and sells it outside\nthe country. I have hired a firm (not a related party) \u2018C\u2019 located abroad to\nfacilitate the supply of software in Europe and the USA; would I be liable to\npay GST on the payments that I make to this entity abroad?\nAnswer: No. In this case, \u2018C\u2019 is covered by the definition of \u2018intermediary\u2019\n[section 2(13) of the IGST Act, 2017]. The place of supply of such intermediary\nservice is location of the supplier in terms of section 13(8) of the IGST Act,\n2017. As \u2018C\u2019 is located outside India, GST is not payable in this case.\nQuestion 12: What factors determine the location of \u2018C\u2019 (in question 11) as\nbeing outside India?\nAnswer: In terms of section 2(15) of the IGST Act, 2017, the location of a\nservice provider is to be determined by applying the following steps sequentially:\n(1) where a supply is made from a place of business for which the\nregistration has been obtained, the location of such place of business;\n(2) where a supply is made from a place other than the place of business for\nwhich registration has been obtained (a fixed establishment elsewhere),\nthe location of such fixed establishment;\n(3) where a supply is made from more than one establishment, whether the\nplace of business or fixed establishment, the location of the\nestablishment most directly concerned with the provision of the supply;\nand\n(4) in absence of such places, the location of the usual place of residence of\nthe supplier. The location of \u2018C\u2019 is to be determined by applying the criterion from (2), or\n(3), or as the case may be, (4).\nQuestion 13: I am an agent in India of a foreign IT/ITES provider (principal\nlocated outside India). For agency services, I bill the principal in convertible\nforeign exchange. Whether GST liability arises in this case?\nAnswer: You are an intermediary and the place of supply of the service\nprovided by you to the principal is in India irrespective of the mode of payment.\nHence, GST is payable on the services provided by you as an intermediary to the\nprincipal.\nQuestion 14: I have more than one SEZ unit in different States; do I need to\ntake separate registrations? Also, I have two SEZ units in one State. Can I take\na single registration?\nAnswer: (1) Yes. Under GST, every entity shall take GST registration in\neach State from which it makes taxable supplies. However, a single registration\ncan be taken for all your SEZ units within a State, whether located in one SEZ or\nmore than one SEZ.\n(2) A person having unit(s) in a Special Economic Zone as well as outside\nthe SEZ in a State shall make a separate application for registration for SEZ\nunit(s) as a business vertical distinct from his other units located outside the\nSpecial Economic Zone in that State (Refer Rule 8(1) of CGST Rules, 2017).\nQuestion 15: I have a unit in the DTA and another in the SEZ; can I take a\ncommon registration?\nAnswer: No. A person having unit(s) in a Special Economic Zone as well as\noutside the SEZ in a State, shall make a separate application for registration for\nSEZ unit(s) as a business vertical distinct from his other units located outside the\nSpecial Economic Zone in that State (Refer Rule 8(1) of CGST Rules, 2017).\nQuestion 16: If I supply a laptop bag along with the laptop to my customer,\nwhat would be the rate of tax leviable?\nAnswer: If the laptop bag is supplied along with the laptop in the ordinary\ncourse of business, the principal supply is that of the laptop and the bag is an\nancillary. Therefore, it is a composite supply and the rate of tax would that as\napplicable to the laptop.\nQuestion 17: I am obtaining online database access services from a company\nabroad over the net, would I have to pay tax on reverse charge?\nAnswer: The recipient, if registered, has to pay the applicable IGST on\nreverse charge basis. If the recipient is not registered, the matter is treated as an\nonline information and database access or retrieval service (OIDAR) and the\nOIDAR service provider is liable to take registration and pay tax.\nQuestion 18: When would it be construed that I have made a supply of services\ninvolving temporary transfer or permitting the use or enjoyment of any\nintellectual property right?\nAnswer: Generally, the End User Licence Agreement (EULA) is the legal\ncontract between a software application author or publisher and the user of that\napplication governing the usage. The agreement is renewable and/or could be\namended from time to time. To find out as to whether there is an element of\nsupply involved when software is delivered to its customer, the terms and\nconditions of EULA are material.\nThe contract for supply therefore assumes significance in this test to decide\nwhether or not there has been \u2018temporary transfer or permitting the use or\nenjoyment of any intellectual property right\u2019.\nQuestion 19: What special provisions are attracted in GST with regard to\nassociated enterprises?\nAnswer: An enterprise which participates, either directly or indirectly,\nthrough one or more intermediaries, in the management, or control or capital of\nthe other enterprise is an associated enterprise. In the context of GST, associated\nenterprise is particularly relevant in the case of supply of services, where the\nsupplier is located outside India. In such cases, the time of supply will be the\nearlier of date of entry in the books of account of the recipient of supply or the\ndate of payment - thus, within \u2018associated enterprises\u2019, the levy under GST is\nattracted once such book entries are made even if no actual payment takes place\nor no invoice is issued.\nQuestion 20: What would be the tax liability on replacement of parts (no\nconsideration is charged from a customer) under a warranty and whether the\nsupplier is required to reverse the input tax credit?\nAnswer: As parts are provided to the customer without a consideration under\nwarranty, no GST is chargeable on such replacement. The value of supply made\nearlier includes the charges to be incurred during the warranty period. Therefore,\nthe supplier who has undertaken the warranty replacement is not required to\nreverse the input tax credit on the parts/components replaced.\nQuestion 21: An Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) has an obligation\nto provide repair services to their customers in the warranty period. This\nactivity is outsourced by OEM to \u2018D\u2019, who bills the OEM for the services he\nprovides to the customer. What is the tax liability of \u2018D\u2019?\nAnswer: \u2018D\u2019 is providing service to the OEM. GST is payable on the value\nof any supplies made by \u2018D\u2019 to OEM i.e. in respect of bills raised by \u2018D\u2019 on the\nOEM.\nQuestion 22: How will the defective parts be sent to the mother warehouse/\nrepairing centre for repair by the downstream repairing centres? What is the\ntax liability?\nAnswer: The defective parts shall be sent for repair on a delivery challan\naccompanied by such e-way bill as may be prescribed. GST shall be chargeable\non the repair amount, including the cost of parts, charged by the repairing centre.\nQuestion 23: What is the tax liability in a scenario where supplies are made\nfrom multiple locations (in different States) of the supplier to the recipient\nunder a single contract?\nAnswer: Delivering services from various locations and integrated pricing\nfor the contract as a whole is the norm in IT/ITES industry. Normally the\ncontract or agreement with the recipient is entered into by one of the branches\n(let us say \u201cMain Branch\u201d). Therefore, in such cases of service delivery from\nmultiple locations of the supplier to the recipient, the supply could be visualized\nas consisting of two distinct supplies. First supply - the different branches of the\nsupplier located across different States are making the supply to the main branch\nwhich entered into a contact or an agreement with the recipient for the supply of\nsuch service. Second supply - main branch is making a supply to the customer.\nGST is to be levied accordingly. In such a scenario, the main branch would get\ninput tax credit of GST paid by the other branches on supplies made by them to\nthe main branch.\nQuestion 24: In the scenario envisaged in previous question, the main branch\nis said to be entitled to ITC of the GST paid by the other branches. Thus, it is a\nrevenue neutral situation. What are the valuation guidelines for such services?\nAnswer: The second proviso to rule 28 of the CGST Rules, 2017 provides\nthat where the recipient is eligible for full input tax credit, the value declared in\nthe invoice shall be deemed to be the open market value of goods and services.\nQuestion 25: Can payment of IGST on reverse charge basis on import of\ngoods/services be done through book entry or ITC?\nAnswer: No. GST payable on reverse charge basis is to be discharged\nthrough cash only. Rule 85(4) of the CGST Rules, 2017 refers.\nQuestion 26: Is the requirement of transferring of credit through ISD\nmechanism mandatory?\nAnswer: The ISD provision under the CGST Act, 2017 is not mandatory. It\nonly provides the manner of distribution of ITC wherever the business entity\nwishes to distribute the ITC as an Input Service Distributor.\nQuestion 27: What is the format for invoices to be issued in the case of reverse\ncharge payment of GST?\n\nAnswer: No separate format for any type of invoicing including self-\ninvoicing has been prescribed. The contents of the invoice have been prescribed\n\nin Rule 46 of the CGST Rules, 2017.\nQuestion 28: I am a software provider, registered at Mumbai. I supply software\nto my clients in Bangalore - would I be required to take a registration in\nKarnataka?\nAnswer: No. The supplies would be treated as inter-State supplies and IGST\nis chargeable on the same.\nQuestion 29: I am an exporter of services. Would I be entitled to refund after\nthe 1st of July (appointed day)?\nAnswer: For exports upto 30th June, 2017 refund may be claimed under the\nprovisions of the Chapter V of the Finance Act, 1994. Exports made on and after\n1st July would be eligible for refund under the GST law.\nNote: Reference to CGST Act, 2017 includes reference to SGST Act,\n2017 and UTGST Act, 2017 also.\n[Source: C.B.E. & C. website, dated 18-8-2017]\n11.

This requires careful attention in procedural issues such as invoicing, time of supply, place of supply, and ITC credit management to ensure compliance and avoid disputes.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFor the sale or transfer of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR):\n\n- **Permanent Transfer**:\n - **General Goods**: Tax rate of 12% (6% CGST + 6% SGST/IGST)\n - **IT Software**: Tax rate of 18% (9% CGST + 9% SGST/IGST)\n\n- **Temporary Transfer (Licensing)**:\n - **General Goods**: Tax rate of 12% (6% CGST + 6% SGST)\n - **IT Software**: Tax rate of 18% (9% CGST + 9% SGST)\n\nThis classification must be carefully handled to ensure correct application of taxes and compliance with GST requirements, as dual classification presents potential challenges and necessitates clear procedural adherence.\n\nIf any additional specific details or scenarios are required, these must be addressed with further specific context or clarifications from relevant GST notifications and rulings."}
{"input": [{"role": "system", "content": "As an expert legal consultant, provide a detailed response to the question below, considering the given context: 1. Meaning of Intellectual Property Right\nIntellectual Property Right (IPR) is not a new concept in the modern world.\nIntellectual Property Rights are set of rights associated with creations of the\nhuman mind that spontaneously emerges from application of intellect, which may\nbe in the form of an invention, design, trademark, formula, product process,\ntechnology, book, goodwill etc. So an output of the human mind may contribute\nto creation of intellectual property rights. Intellectual property has been\nrecognized as a very important asset for any business in the present scenario of\nworld economy. Intellectual property rights are protected by statutory laws.\n2. Protection of Intellectual Property Rights\nIn India Government has made legislation for the protection of Intellectual\nProperty Rights namely, Patents Act, Copyright Act. Trademarks Act and\nDesigns Act. With regard to protection of Intellectual property rights in other\ncountries, they follow the international legal instruments. The establishment of\nthe World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) is an important milestone\nin the history of human-kind that recognizes the legitimate rights of the creator of\nthe work and protects him against unfair competition.\n3. Taxable event under GST\n\u201cSupply\u201d is the taxable event under GST, in place of \u201ctaxable goods \u201cand\n\u201ctaxable services\u201d as was prevailed in the earlier tax laws for the purpose of levy\nof tax. Section 2(108) of the CGST Act, defines \u201cTaxable supply\u201d means a\nsupply of goods or services or both which is leviable to tax under GST. Thus,\nGST is levied upon the \u201csupplies of goods and services\u201d. Section 9(1) of the CGST Act, states that tax shall be levied on the transaction value of a supply of\ngoods or services or both.\n4. Definition of \u201cGoods\u201d\nSection 2(52) of the CGST Act, \u201cgoods\u201d means every kind of movable\nproperty other than money and securities but includes actionable claim, growing\ncrops, grass and things attached to or forming part of the land which are agreed to\nbe severed before supply or under a contract of supply;\n5. Definition of \u201cServices\u201d\nSection 2(102) of the CGST Act, \u201cservices\u201d means anything other than\ngoods, money and securities but includes activities relating to the use of money\nor its conversion by cash or by any other mode, from one form, currency or\ndenomination, to another form, currency or denomination for which a separate\nconsideration is charged;\n6. Intellectual Property Rights under GST\nEven though, Intellectual Property Rights has not been defined under CGST\nAct; by plain reading of the definition of \u201cgoods\u201d it is clear that Intellectual\nProperty Rights qualifies as goods. Further, section 5(c) of schedule II of the\nCGST Act, specified that \u201ctemporary transfer or permitting the use or enjoyment\nof any intellectual property right to be considered as supply of services.\nAccordingly, the Central Government, on the recommendations of the GST\nCouncil, have notified the taxable rates of \u201cIntellectual property rights \u201cboth\nunder classification of goods as well as classification of services.\n7. Classification & rate of Services of IPR\nWhile notifying the taxable rates of services vide Notification No. 11/2017\n(Rate), dated 28-6-2017 has classified Intellectual Property Rights at Sl. No. 17\nare reproduced as under:\nS.\nNo.\nChapter/Section/\nHeading\n\nDescription of Service Rate of Tax\n@\n\n17 Heading 9973\n(Leasing or rental\nservices, with or\nwithout operator)\n\n(i) Temporary or Permanent transfer\nor permitting the use or enjoyment\nof Intellectual Property (IP) right\nin respect of goods other than\nInformation Technology software.\n12%\n(6% CGST +\n6% SGST)\n\n(ii) Temporary or permanent transfer\nor permitting the use or enjoyment\nof Intellectual Property (IP) right\nin respect of Information\nTechnology Software.\n\n18%\n(9% CGST +\n9% SGST)\n\nThe scheme of \u201cclassification of services\u201d for the Heading 9973 only\nprovides for licensing services (temporary transfer) for right to use the IPR.\nGenerally, the End User Licence Agreement is the legal contract between a\nsoftware application author or publisher and the user of that application\ngoverning the usage. The agreement is renewable and/or could be amended from\ntime to time. To find out as to whether there is an element of supply involved\nwhen software is delivered to its customer; the terms and conditions of End User\nLicence Agreement are material. The contract for supply therefore assumes\nsignificant in this test to decide whether or not there has been \u2018temporary transfer\nor permitting the use or enjoyment of any intellectual property right.\nThus temporary/permanent transfer a particular intellectual property right\nwould be considered as supply of service and 12% tax would be levied on the\ntransaction value provided such IPR is not in respect of software. The\nsale/licensing of intellectual property right pertaining to software would be\ncharged 18% tax.\nIt is pertinent to mention that the Constitutional amendment Act, 2016 did\nnot amend Article 366(29A)(d) which specifies that the transfer of the right to\nuse any goods is to be deemed as a sale of those goods. Further, once IPR is\ntreated as goods, a permanent transfer of such IPR would amount to a sale of\ngoods; will be the same as to a supply of goods. However, the Central\nGovernment while notifying the tax rate of services has classified the transfer of\nthe right to use any goods to be treated as service.\n8. Classification & rate of goods of IPR\nWhile taxable rates of goods were notified vide Notification No. 1/2017-C.T.\n(Rate), dated 28-6-2017, unfortunately this notification did not contains any\nspecific entry or rates for taxing Intellectual Property Rights as goods.\nSubsequently, as per the recommendations made by the GST Council meeting\nheld on 10th November, 2017, rates of Intellectual property rights has been\ninserted at Sl. No. 243 of amended Notification No. 41/2017-C.T. (Rate), dated\n14-11-2017, which is reproduced as under:\nS.\nNo.\nChapter/Heading/\nSub-heading/\nTariff item\n\nDescription of Goods Rate of\nTax @\n\n243 Any Chapter Permanent transfer of Intellectual\nProperty (IP) right in respect of\ngoods other than Information\nTechnology software.\n\n12%\n(6% CGST +\n6% SGST)\nThe above classification of goods and tax rates relating to permanent transfer\nof Intellectual Property right in respect of goods other than IT software will\nattract tax @ 12%, which is equal to service classification notification. It is\npertinent to mention that when the rate of \u201cIntellectual property rights \u201chas been\ninserted under goods notification, corresponding deletion has not been done to\nthe service notification. This amendment has given a confirmation that\npermanent transfer of intellectual property rights would be taxed as supply of\ngoods where as temporary transfer of intellectual property rights would be taxed\nas supply of services. This dual classification of tax rates would create unnecessary procedural problems, relating to time of supply, place of supply,\ninvoicing, accounting of ITC credit and proper availment of ITC credit.\n9. Tax Rates of IGST for Goods\nFurther, the Central Government on the recommendations of the GST\nCouncil has notified the tax rates of integrated tax for goods vide Notification\nNo. 1/2017-I.T., dated 28-6-2017 and shall be\nCharged in respect of inter-State supplies of goods as under:\n(i) 5% in respect of goods specified in Schedule-I.\n(ii) 12% in respect of goods specified in Schedule-II.\n(iii) 18% in respect of goods specified in Schedule-III.\n(iv) 28% in respect of goods specified in Schedule-IV.\n(v) 3% in respect of goods specified in Schedule V and\n(vi) 25% in respect of goods specified in Schedule-VI.\nThe details of schedules with chapter heading has been annexed to the said\nNotification, the tax shall be levied on inter-State supplies of goods, the\ndescription of which is specified in the corresponding entry in column (3) of the\nsaid schedules, falling under the Heading/sub-heading/Tariff item or chapter, as\nthe case may be, as specified in the corresponding entry in column (2) of the said\nSchedules. The chapter heading/sub-heading which is specified in the First\nSchedule to the Customs Tariff Act, 1975. In order to tax goods both column 2\nand column 3 have to read conjunctively.\nOn perusal of all schedules and chapter headings annexed to the said\nNotification, unfortunately there is no chapter covering of IPR under the Customs\nTariff Act, 1975. The Central Government as well as GST Council has failed to\n\ntake note of the same to declare tax rates for IPR to be charged tax rate for inter-\nState supplies of IPR.\n\nLater, the Central Government with recommendation of GST Council has\nbrought amendment to the said tax rates vide Notification No. 43/2017-I.T.\n(Rate), dated 14-11-2017, which is extracted as under:\nS.\nNo.\nChapter/\nHeading/\nsub-heading/\nTariff item\n\nDescription of Goods Rate of Tax @\n\n243 Any Chapter Permanent transfer of Intellectual\nProperty (IP) right in respect of goods\nother than Information Technology\nsoftware.\n\n12%\n(6% CGST +\n6% IGST)\nThe above table is showing tax rate has been inserted vide said Notification\ndated 14th November, 2017 for IPR, wherein it is specified that a permanent\ntransfer of Intellectual Property Right (IPR) is to be taxed @12% (6% CGST +\n6% IGST) (in Schedule II) for inter-State supplies. It is pertinent to mention there are no chapter heading/tariff heading of Customs rather it has been mentioned as\n\u201cany chapter\u201d then is it proper to charge IGST without any chapter heading or\nsub-heading of Customs. It may be questioned by the taxpayers whether to pay\nIGST or not in the absence of chapter heading.\nThe tax rate for services under Heading 9973 as classified under GST will\ncreate confusion as well as litigation. There is need of proper classification of\nIPR/tax rates of CGST, SGST & IGST for goods. It is pertinent to mention that\nthere is no rate of tax on IPR as goods during the period 1st July\u20192017 to 13th\nNovember\u20192017. The Central Government as well as GST Council even though\nhas notified tax rate of IPR as goods by inserting necessary entry in CGST rate\nand IGST rate but both the Notifications have been declared as prospective.\nSince the imposition of rate is not retrospective to cover the tax rate period from\n1st July\u20192017 to 13th November\u20192017, demands raised on permanent transfer of\nIPR will create litigations in the coming days.\nThus, It is observed that, under GST is the dual Classification of rate of tax\non IPR needs to be reviewed by the GST Council and necessary clarification may\nbe issued for smooth tax collection and reduction of probable litigation on\naccount of interpretation of taxability on IPR in the coming days.\n10. FAQ for GST on IT/ITES\nQuestion 1: Whether software is regarded as goods or services in GST?\nAnswer: In terms of Schedule II of the CGST Act, 2017, development,\ndesign, programming, customisation, adaptation, upgradation, enhancement,\nimplementation of information technology software and temporary transfer or\npermitting the use or enjoyment of any intellectual property right are treated as\nservices.\nBut, if a pre-developed or pre-designed software is supplied in any medium/\nstorage (commonly bought off-the-shelf) or made available through the use of\nencryption keys, the same is treated as a supply of goods classifiable under\nheading 8523.\nQuestion 2: What are the implications of recognising the development, design,\nprogramming, customisation, adaptation, upgradation, enhancement, and\nimplementation of information technology software as a service?\nAnswer: The primary implication is that the place of supply rules applicable\nto services would apply in determining taxability of the supply of software\nservices. The same would be applicable in situations of supply of services\ninvolving a temporary transfer or permitting the use or enjoyment of any\nintellectual property right. The other implication is that the supplier of software\nservices would not be eligible for the composition scheme.\nQuestion 3: \u2018A\u2019 is a dealer in Computers and Computer parts having turnover\nof Rs. 8 lakh in a year; does \u2018A\u2019 have to register under GST?\nAnswer: Every supplier located in a State or Union territory, whose\n\u201caggregate turnover\u201d in a financial year exceeds twenty lakh rupees, is liable to\nbe registered under GST. This limit of turnover for a special category State is ten lakh rupees. \u2018A\u2019, whose aggregate turnover is only Rs. 8 lakh in a year, is\ntherefore not liable to registration.\nQuestion 4: The registered person \u2018B\u2019 receives small portions of software code\nfrom individuals which he then integrates and supply as a package to clients.\nThese individuals are having small turnover of Rs. 5 to 10 lakh, and therefore\nare not registered in GST. Whether there is any liability on \u2018B\u2019 in respect of\nservices provided by such individuals?\nAnswer: If the supplies are made by unregistered suppliers, GST is liable to\nbe paid by the recipient, who is a registered person, under section 9(4) of the\nCGST Act, 2017. Therefore, in this case \u2018B\u2019 is liable to pay GST on services\nprovided by these individuals. \u2018B\u2019 can claim credit of this tax paid by him on\nreverse charge.\nQuestion 5: What is the rate of tax on IT services?\nAnswer: The rate of GST on IT services is 18%.\nQuestion 6: Whether exports of software services attract GST?\n\nAnswer: Exports and supplies to SEZ units and SEZ developers are zero-\nrated in GST. Zero-rating effectively means that no tax is payable on exports but\n\nthe exporter/supplier is entitled to the input tax credit on inputs/input services\nused in relation to exports. The exporters have two options for zero rating, which\nare as follows:\n(1) To pay integrated tax on supplies meant to be exported and get refund of\ntax so paid after the supply is exported.\n(2) To make export supplies under a bond or letter of undertaking and claim\nrefund of taxes suffered on inputs and input services in relation to such\nexports.\nQuestion 7: How do I determine whether IT services provided by me constitute\nexport of service?\nAnswer: The supply of any service is considered an export of service, where\nthe following conditions are met:\n(1) the supplier of service is located in India;\n(2) the recipient of service is located outside India;\n(3) the place of supply of service is outside India;\n(4) the payment for such service has been received by the supplier of service\nin convertible foreign exchange; and\n(5) the supplier of service and the recipient of service are not merely\nestablishments of a distinct person in accordance with explanation 1 of\nsection 8 of the IGST Act, 2017.\nQuestion 8: How do I determine the place of supply of IT/ITES services?\nAnswer: Place of supply of IT/ITES services is the location of the recipient\nin terms of section 12 and 13 of the IGST Act, 2017. However, if the recipient is not registered and his address is not available on the records of the supplier, the\nplace of supply would be the location of the supplier.\nQuestion 9: How to determine the location of the recipient?\nAnswer: Location of the recipient of service is defined in section 2(14) of\nthe IGST Act. A recipient of services is treated as located outside India if his\nplace of business where he receives services is outside India or, if he does not\nhave a place of business, his usual place of residence is outside India.\nQuestion 10: Would I be liable to pay GST on reverse charge even if the\nforeign supplier of software from whom I buy for use in my firm registered\nunder GST was to accept the payment in Indian Rupees?\nAnswer: Yes, you would be liable to pay GST. A supply is treated as an\nimport of service if the following conditions are satisfied:\n(1) the supplier of service is located outside India;\n(2) the recipient of service is located in India; and\n(3) the place of supply of service is in India.\nThe place of such supply would be taken to be the location where the firm is\nregistered (in GST) and the supplies would attract integrated tax (IGST). The\nfactum of which currency was used to pay the consideration is immaterial.\nQuestion 11: I am an Indian Company who makes software and sells it outside\nthe country. I have hired a firm (not a related party) \u2018C\u2019 located abroad to\nfacilitate the supply of software in Europe and the USA; would I be liable to\npay GST on the payments that I make to this entity abroad?\nAnswer: No. In this case, \u2018C\u2019 is covered by the definition of \u2018intermediary\u2019\n[section 2(13) of the IGST Act, 2017]. The place of supply of such intermediary\nservice is location of the supplier in terms of section 13(8) of the IGST Act,\n2017. As \u2018C\u2019 is located outside India, GST is not payable in this case.\nQuestion 12: What factors determine the location of \u2018C\u2019 (in question 11) as\nbeing outside India?\nAnswer: In terms of section 2(15) of the IGST Act, 2017, the location of a\nservice provider is to be determined by applying the following steps sequentially:\n(1) where a supply is made from a place of business for which the\nregistration has been obtained, the location of such place of business;\n(2) where a supply is made from a place other than the place of business for\nwhich registration has been obtained (a fixed establishment elsewhere),\nthe location of such fixed establishment;\n(3) where a supply is made from more than one establishment, whether the\nplace of business or fixed establishment, the location of the\nestablishment most directly concerned with the provision of the supply;\nand\n(4) in absence of such places, the location of the usual place of residence of\nthe supplier. The location of \u2018C\u2019 is to be determined by applying the criterion from (2), or\n(3), or as the case may be, (4).\nQuestion 13: I am an agent in India of a foreign IT/ITES provider (principal\nlocated outside India). For agency services, I bill the principal in convertible\nforeign exchange. Whether GST liability arises in this case?\nAnswer: You are an intermediary and the place of supply of the service\nprovided by you to the principal is in India irrespective of the mode of payment.\nHence, GST is payable on the services provided by you as an intermediary to the\nprincipal.\nQuestion 14: I have more than one SEZ unit in different States; do I need to\ntake separate registrations? Also, I have two SEZ units in one State. Can I take\na single registration?\nAnswer: (1) Yes. Under GST, every entity shall take GST registration in\neach State from which it makes taxable supplies. However, a single registration\ncan be taken for all your SEZ units within a State, whether located in one SEZ or\nmore than one SEZ.\n(2) A person having unit(s) in a Special Economic Zone as well as outside\nthe SEZ in a State shall make a separate application for registration for SEZ\nunit(s) as a business vertical distinct from his other units located outside the\nSpecial Economic Zone in that State (Refer Rule 8(1) of CGST Rules, 2017).\nQuestion 15: I have a unit in the DTA and another in the SEZ; can I take a\ncommon registration?\nAnswer: No. A person having unit(s) in a Special Economic Zone as well as\noutside the SEZ in a State, shall make a separate application for registration for\nSEZ unit(s) as a business vertical distinct from his other units located outside the\nSpecial Economic Zone in that State (Refer Rule 8(1) of CGST Rules, 2017).\nQuestion 16: If I supply a laptop bag along with the laptop to my customer,\nwhat would be the rate of tax leviable?\nAnswer: If the laptop bag is supplied along with the laptop in the ordinary\ncourse of business, the principal supply is that of the laptop and the bag is an\nancillary. Therefore, it is a composite supply and the rate of tax would that as\napplicable to the laptop.\nQuestion 17: I am obtaining online database access services from a company\nabroad over the net, would I have to pay tax on reverse charge?\nAnswer: The recipient, if registered, has to pay the applicable IGST on\nreverse charge basis. If the recipient is not registered, the matter is treated as an\nonline information and database access or retrieval service (OIDAR) and the\nOIDAR service provider is liable to take registration and pay tax.\nQuestion 18: When would it be construed that I have made a supply of services\ninvolving temporary transfer or permitting the use or enjoyment of any\nintellectual property right?\nAnswer: Generally, the End User Licence Agreement (EULA) is the legal\ncontract between a software application author or publisher and the user of that\napplication governing the usage. The agreement is renewable and/or could be\namended from time to time. To find out as to whether there is an element of\nsupply involved when software is delivered to its customer, the terms and\nconditions of EULA are material.\nThe contract for supply therefore assumes significance in this test to decide\nwhether or not there has been \u2018temporary transfer or permitting the use or\nenjoyment of any intellectual property right\u2019.\nQuestion 19: What special provisions are attracted in GST with regard to\nassociated enterprises?\nAnswer: An enterprise which participates, either directly or indirectly,\nthrough one or more intermediaries, in the management, or control or capital of\nthe other enterprise is an associated enterprise. In the context of GST, associated\nenterprise is particularly relevant in the case of supply of services, where the\nsupplier is located outside India. In such cases, the time of supply will be the\nearlier of date of entry in the books of account of the recipient of supply or the\ndate of payment - thus, within \u2018associated enterprises\u2019, the levy under GST is\nattracted once such book entries are made even if no actual payment takes place\nor no invoice is issued.\nQuestion 20: What would be the tax liability on replacement of parts (no\nconsideration is charged from a customer) under a warranty and whether the\nsupplier is required to reverse the input tax credit?\nAnswer: As parts are provided to the customer without a consideration under\nwarranty, no GST is chargeable on such replacement. The value of supply made\nearlier includes the charges to be incurred during the warranty period. Therefore,\nthe supplier who has undertaken the warranty replacement is not required to\nreverse the input tax credit on the parts/components replaced.\nQuestion 21: An Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) has an obligation\nto provide repair services to their customers in the warranty period. This\nactivity is outsourced by OEM to \u2018D\u2019, who bills the OEM for the services he\nprovides to the customer. What is the tax liability of \u2018D\u2019?\nAnswer: \u2018D\u2019 is providing service to the OEM. GST is payable on the value\nof any supplies made by \u2018D\u2019 to OEM i.e. in respect of bills raised by \u2018D\u2019 on the\nOEM.\nQuestion 22: How will the defective parts be sent to the mother warehouse/\nrepairing centre for repair by the downstream repairing centres? What is the\ntax liability?\nAnswer: The defective parts shall be sent for repair on a delivery challan\naccompanied by such e-way bill as may be prescribed. GST shall be chargeable\non the repair amount, including the cost of parts, charged by the repairing centre.\nQuestion 23: What is the tax liability in a scenario where supplies are made\nfrom multiple locations (in different States) of the supplier to the recipient\nunder a single contract?\nAnswer: Delivering services from various locations and integrated pricing\nfor the contract as a whole is the norm in IT/ITES industry. Normally the\ncontract or agreement with the recipient is entered into by one of the branches\n(let us say \u201cMain Branch\u201d). Therefore, in such cases of service delivery from\nmultiple locations of the supplier to the recipient, the supply could be visualized\nas consisting of two distinct supplies. First supply - the different branches of the\nsupplier located across different States are making the supply to the main branch\nwhich entered into a contact or an agreement with the recipient for the supply of\nsuch service. Second supply - main branch is making a supply to the customer.\nGST is to be levied accordingly. In such a scenario, the main branch would get\ninput tax credit of GST paid by the other branches on supplies made by them to\nthe main branch.\nQuestion 24: In the scenario envisaged in previous question, the main branch\nis said to be entitled to ITC of the GST paid by the other branches. Thus, it is a\nrevenue neutral situation. What are the valuation guidelines for such services?\nAnswer: The second proviso to rule 28 of the CGST Rules, 2017 provides\nthat where the recipient is eligible for full input tax credit, the value declared in\nthe invoice shall be deemed to be the open market value of goods and services.\nQuestion 25: Can payment of IGST on reverse charge basis on import of\ngoods/services be done through book entry or ITC?\nAnswer: No. GST payable on reverse charge basis is to be discharged\nthrough cash only. Rule 85(4) of the CGST Rules, 2017 refers.\nQuestion 26: Is the requirement of transferring of credit through ISD\nmechanism mandatory?\nAnswer: The ISD provision under the CGST Act, 2017 is not mandatory. It\nonly provides the manner of distribution of ITC wherever the business entity\nwishes to distribute the ITC as an Input Service Distributor.\nQuestion 27: What is the format for invoices to be issued in the case of reverse\ncharge payment of GST?\n\nAnswer: No separate format for any type of invoicing including self-\ninvoicing has been prescribed. The contents of the invoice have been prescribed\n\nin Rule 46 of the CGST Rules, 2017.\nQuestion 28: I am a software provider, registered at Mumbai. I supply software\nto my clients in Bangalore - would I be required to take a registration in\nKarnataka?\nAnswer: No. The supplies would be treated as inter-State supplies and IGST\nis chargeable on the same.\nQuestion 29: I am an exporter of services. Would I be entitled to refund after\nthe 1st of July (appointed day)?\nAnswer: For exports upto 30th June, 2017 refund may be claimed under the\nprovisions of the Chapter V of the Finance Act, 1994. Exports made on and after\n1st July would be eligible for refund under the GST law.\nNote: Reference to CGST Act, 2017 includes reference to SGST Act,\n2017 and UTGST Act, 2017 also.\n[Source: C.B.E. & C. website, dated 18-8-2017]\n11.

This requires careful attention in procedural issues such as invoicing, time of supply, place of supply, and ITC credit management to ensure compliance and avoid disputes.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFor the sale or transfer of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR):\n\n- **Permanent Transfer**:\n - **General Goods**: Tax rate of 12% (6% CGST + 6% SGST/IGST)\n - **IT Software**: Tax rate of 18% (9% CGST + 9% SGST/IGST)\n\n- **Temporary Transfer (Licensing)**:\n - **General Goods**: Tax rate of 12% (6% CGST + 6% SGST)\n - **IT Software**: Tax rate of 18% (9% CGST + 9% SGST)\n\nThis classification must be carefully handled to ensure correct application of taxes and compliance with GST requirements, as dual classification presents potential challenges and necessitates clear procedural adherence.\n\nIf any additional specific details or scenarios are required, these must be addressed with further specific context or clarifications from relevant GST notifications and rulings."}
{"input": [{"role": "system", "content": "As an expert legal consultant, provide a detailed response to the question below, considering the given context: 1. Meaning of Intellectual Property Right\nIntellectual Property Right (IPR) is not a new concept in the modern world.\nIntellectual Property Rights are set of rights associated with creations of the\nhuman mind that spontaneously emerges from application of intellect, which may\nbe in the form of an invention, design, trademark, formula, product process,\ntechnology, book, goodwill etc. So an output of the human mind may contribute\nto creation of intellectual property rights. Intellectual property has been\nrecognized as a very important asset for any business in the present scenario of\nworld economy. Intellectual property rights are protected by statutory laws.\n2. Protection of Intellectual Property Rights\nIn India Government has made legislation for the protection of Intellectual\nProperty Rights namely, Patents Act, Copyright Act. Trademarks Act and\nDesigns Act. With regard to protection of Intellectual property rights in other\ncountries, they follow the international legal instruments. The establishment of\nthe World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) is an important milestone\nin the history of human-kind that recognizes the legitimate rights of the creator of\nthe work and protects him against unfair competition.\n3. Taxable event under GST\n\u201cSupply\u201d is the taxable event under GST, in place of \u201ctaxable goods \u201cand\n\u201ctaxable services\u201d as was prevailed in the earlier tax laws for the purpose of levy\nof tax. Section 2(108) of the CGST Act, defines \u201cTaxable supply\u201d means a\nsupply of goods or services or both which is leviable to tax under GST. Thus,\nGST is levied upon the \u201csupplies of goods and services\u201d. Section 9(1) of the CGST Act, states that tax shall be levied on the transaction value of a supply of\ngoods or services or both.\n4. Definition of \u201cGoods\u201d\nSection 2(52) of the CGST Act, \u201cgoods\u201d means every kind of movable\nproperty other than money and securities but includes actionable claim, growing\ncrops, grass and things attached to or forming part of the land which are agreed to\nbe severed before supply or under a contract of supply;\n5. Definition of \u201cServices\u201d\nSection 2(102) of the CGST Act, \u201cservices\u201d means anything other than\ngoods, money and securities but includes activities relating to the use of money\nor its conversion by cash or by any other mode, from one form, currency or\ndenomination, to another form, currency or denomination for which a separate\nconsideration is charged;\n6. Intellectual Property Rights under GST\nEven though, Intellectual Property Rights has not been defined under CGST\nAct; by plain reading of the definition of \u201cgoods\u201d it is clear that Intellectual\nProperty Rights qualifies as goods. Further, section 5(c) of schedule II of the\nCGST Act, specified that \u201ctemporary transfer or permitting the use or enjoyment\nof any intellectual property right to be considered as supply of services.\nAccordingly, the Central Government, on the recommendations of the GST\nCouncil, have notified the taxable rates of \u201cIntellectual property rights \u201cboth\nunder classification of goods as well as classification of services.\n7. Classification & rate of Services of IPR\nWhile notifying the taxable rates of services vide Notification No. 11/2017\n(Rate), dated 28-6-2017 has classified Intellectual Property Rights at Sl. No. 17\nare reproduced as under:\nS.\nNo.\nChapter/Section/\nHeading\n\nDescription of Service Rate of Tax\n@\n\n17 Heading 9973\n(Leasing or rental\nservices, with or\nwithout operator)\n\n(i) Temporary or Permanent transfer\nor permitting the use or enjoyment\nof Intellectual Property (IP) right\nin respect of goods other than\nInformation Technology software.\n12%\n(6% CGST +\n6% SGST)\n\n(ii) Temporary or permanent transfer\nor permitting the use or enjoyment\nof Intellectual Property (IP) right\nin respect of Information\nTechnology Software.\n\n18%\n(9% CGST +\n9% SGST)\n\nThe scheme of \u201cclassification of services\u201d for the Heading 9973 only\nprovides for licensing services (temporary transfer) for right to use the IPR.\nGenerally, the End User Licence Agreement is the legal contract between a\nsoftware application author or publisher and the user of that application\ngoverning the usage. The agreement is renewable and/or could be amended from\ntime to time. To find out as to whether there is an element of supply involved\nwhen software is delivered to its customer; the terms and conditions of End User\nLicence Agreement are material. The contract for supply therefore assumes\nsignificant in this test to decide whether or not there has been \u2018temporary transfer\nor permitting the use or enjoyment of any intellectual property right.\nThus temporary/permanent transfer a particular intellectual property right\nwould be considered as supply of service and 12% tax would be levied on the\ntransaction value provided such IPR is not in respect of software. The\nsale/licensing of intellectual property right pertaining to software would be\ncharged 18% tax.\nIt is pertinent to mention that the Constitutional amendment Act, 2016 did\nnot amend Article 366(29A)(d) which specifies that the transfer of the right to\nuse any goods is to be deemed as a sale of those goods. Further, once IPR is\ntreated as goods, a permanent transfer of such IPR would amount to a sale of\ngoods; will be the same as to a supply of goods. However, the Central\nGovernment while notifying the tax rate of services has classified the transfer of\nthe right to use any goods to be treated as service.\n8. Classification & rate of goods of IPR\nWhile taxable rates of goods were notified vide Notification No. 1/2017-C.T.\n(Rate), dated 28-6-2017, unfortunately this notification did not contains any\nspecific entry or rates for taxing Intellectual Property Rights as goods.\nSubsequently, as per the recommendations made by the GST Council meeting\nheld on 10th November, 2017, rates of Intellectual property rights has been\ninserted at Sl. No. 243 of amended Notification No. 41/2017-C.T. (Rate), dated\n14-11-2017, which is reproduced as under:\nS.\nNo.\nChapter/Heading/\nSub-heading/\nTariff item\n\nDescription of Goods Rate of\nTax @\n\n243 Any Chapter Permanent transfer of Intellectual\nProperty (IP) right in respect of\ngoods other than Information\nTechnology software.\n\n12%\n(6% CGST +\n6% SGST)\nThe above classification of goods and tax rates relating to permanent transfer\nof Intellectual Property right in respect of goods other than IT software will\nattract tax @ 12%, which is equal to service classification notification. It is\npertinent to mention that when the rate of \u201cIntellectual property rights \u201chas been\ninserted under goods notification, corresponding deletion has not been done to\nthe service notification. This amendment has given a confirmation that\npermanent transfer of intellectual property rights would be taxed as supply of\ngoods where as temporary transfer of intellectual property rights would be taxed\nas supply of services. This dual classification of tax rates would create unnecessary procedural problems, relating to time of supply, place of supply,\ninvoicing, accounting of ITC credit and proper availment of ITC credit.\n9. Tax Rates of IGST for Goods\nFurther, the Central Government on the recommendations of the GST\nCouncil has notified the tax rates of integrated tax for goods vide Notification\nNo. 1/2017-I.T., dated 28-6-2017 and shall be\nCharged in respect of inter-State supplies of goods as under:\n(i) 5% in respect of goods specified in Schedule-I.\n(ii) 12% in respect of goods specified in Schedule-II.\n(iii) 18% in respect of goods specified in Schedule-III.\n(iv) 28% in respect of goods specified in Schedule-IV.\n(v) 3% in respect of goods specified in Schedule V and\n(vi) 25% in respect of goods specified in Schedule-VI.\nThe details of schedules with chapter heading has been annexed to the said\nNotification, the tax shall be levied on inter-State supplies of goods, the\ndescription of which is specified in the corresponding entry in column (3) of the\nsaid schedules, falling under the Heading/sub-heading/Tariff item or chapter, as\nthe case may be, as specified in the corresponding entry in column (2) of the said\nSchedules. The chapter heading/sub-heading which is specified in the First\nSchedule to the Customs Tariff Act, 1975. In order to tax goods both column 2\nand column 3 have to read conjunctively.\nOn perusal of all schedules and chapter headings annexed to the said\nNotification, unfortunately there is no chapter covering of IPR under the Customs\nTariff Act, 1975. The Central Government as well as GST Council has failed to\n\ntake note of the same to declare tax rates for IPR to be charged tax rate for inter-\nState supplies of IPR.\n\nLater, the Central Government with recommendation of GST Council has\nbrought amendment to the said tax rates vide Notification No. 43/2017-I.T.\n(Rate), dated 14-11-2017, which is extracted as under:\nS.\nNo.\nChapter/\nHeading/\nsub-heading/\nTariff item\n\nDescription of Goods Rate of Tax @\n\n243 Any Chapter Permanent transfer of Intellectual\nProperty (IP) right in respect of goods\nother than Information Technology\nsoftware.\n\n12%\n(6% CGST +\n6% IGST)\nThe above table is showing tax rate has been inserted vide said Notification\ndated 14th November, 2017 for IPR, wherein it is specified that a permanent\ntransfer of Intellectual Property Right (IPR) is to be taxed @12% (6% CGST +\n6% IGST) (in Schedule II) for inter-State supplies. It is pertinent to mention there are no chapter heading/tariff heading of Customs rather it has been mentioned as\n\u201cany chapter\u201d then is it proper to charge IGST without any chapter heading or\nsub-heading of Customs. It may be questioned by the taxpayers whether to pay\nIGST or not in the absence of chapter heading.\nThe tax rate for services under Heading 9973 as classified under GST will\ncreate confusion as well as litigation. There is need of proper classification of\nIPR/tax rates of CGST, SGST & IGST for goods. It is pertinent to mention that\nthere is no rate of tax on IPR as goods during the period 1st July\u20192017 to 13th\nNovember\u20192017. The Central Government as well as GST Council even though\nhas notified tax rate of IPR as goods by inserting necessary entry in CGST rate\nand IGST rate but both the Notifications have been declared as prospective.\nSince the imposition of rate is not retrospective to cover the tax rate period from\n1st July\u20192017 to 13th November\u20192017, demands raised on permanent transfer of\nIPR will create litigations in the coming days.\nThus, It is observed that, under GST is the dual Classification of rate of tax\non IPR needs to be reviewed by the GST Council and necessary clarification may\nbe issued for smooth tax collection and reduction of probable litigation on\naccount of interpretation of taxability on IPR in the coming days.\n10. FAQ for GST on IT/ITES\nQuestion 1: Whether software is regarded as goods or services in GST?\nAnswer: In terms of Schedule II of the CGST Act, 2017, development,\ndesign, programming, customisation, adaptation, upgradation, enhancement,\nimplementation of information technology software and temporary transfer or\npermitting the use or enjoyment of any intellectual property right are treated as\nservices.\nBut, if a pre-developed or pre-designed software is supplied in any medium/\nstorage (commonly bought off-the-shelf) or made available through the use of\nencryption keys, the same is treated as a supply of goods classifiable under\nheading 8523.\nQuestion 2: What are the implications of recognising the development, design,\nprogramming, customisation, adaptation, upgradation, enhancement, and\nimplementation of information technology software as a service?\nAnswer: The primary implication is that the place of supply rules applicable\nto services would apply in determining taxability of the supply of software\nservices. The same would be applicable in situations of supply of services\ninvolving a temporary transfer or permitting the use or enjoyment of any\nintellectual property right. The other implication is that the supplier of software\nservices would not be eligible for the composition scheme.\nQuestion 3: \u2018A\u2019 is a dealer in Computers and Computer parts having turnover\nof Rs. 8 lakh in a year; does \u2018A\u2019 have to register under GST?\nAnswer: Every supplier located in a State or Union territory, whose\n\u201caggregate turnover\u201d in a financial year exceeds twenty lakh rupees, is liable to\nbe registered under GST. This limit of turnover for a special category State is ten lakh rupees. \u2018A\u2019, whose aggregate turnover is only Rs. 8 lakh in a year, is\ntherefore not liable to registration.\nQuestion 4: The registered person \u2018B\u2019 receives small portions of software code\nfrom individuals which he then integrates and supply as a package to clients.\nThese individuals are having small turnover of Rs. 5 to 10 lakh, and therefore\nare not registered in GST. Whether there is any liability on \u2018B\u2019 in respect of\nservices provided by such individuals?\nAnswer: If the supplies are made by unregistered suppliers, GST is liable to\nbe paid by the recipient, who is a registered person, under section 9(4) of the\nCGST Act, 2017. Therefore, in this case \u2018B\u2019 is liable to pay GST on services\nprovided by these individuals. \u2018B\u2019 can claim credit of this tax paid by him on\nreverse charge.\nQuestion 5: What is the rate of tax on IT services?\nAnswer: The rate of GST on IT services is 18%.\nQuestion 6: Whether exports of software services attract GST?\n\nAnswer: Exports and supplies to SEZ units and SEZ developers are zero-\nrated in GST. Zero-rating effectively means that no tax is payable on exports but\n\nthe exporter/supplier is entitled to the input tax credit on inputs/input services\nused in relation to exports. The exporters have two options for zero rating, which\nare as follows:\n(1) To pay integrated tax on supplies meant to be exported and get refund of\ntax so paid after the supply is exported.\n(2) To make export supplies under a bond or letter of undertaking and claim\nrefund of taxes suffered on inputs and input services in relation to such\nexports.\nQuestion 7: How do I determine whether IT services provided by me constitute\nexport of service?\nAnswer: The supply of any service is considered an export of service, where\nthe following conditions are met:\n(1) the supplier of service is located in India;\n(2) the recipient of service is located outside India;\n(3) the place of supply of service is outside India;\n(4) the payment for such service has been received by the supplier of service\nin convertible foreign exchange; and\n(5) the supplier of service and the recipient of service are not merely\nestablishments of a distinct person in accordance with explanation 1 of\nsection 8 of the IGST Act, 2017.\nQuestion 8: How do I determine the place of supply of IT/ITES services?\nAnswer: Place of supply of IT/ITES services is the location of the recipient\nin terms of section 12 and 13 of the IGST Act, 2017. However, if the recipient is not registered and his address is not available on the records of the supplier, the\nplace of supply would be the location of the supplier.\nQuestion 9: How to determine the location of the recipient?\nAnswer: Location of the recipient of service is defined in section 2(14) of\nthe IGST Act. A recipient of services is treated as located outside India if his\nplace of business where he receives services is outside India or, if he does not\nhave a place of business, his usual place of residence is outside India.\nQuestion 10: Would I be liable to pay GST on reverse charge even if the\nforeign supplier of software from whom I buy for use in my firm registered\nunder GST was to accept the payment in Indian Rupees?\nAnswer: Yes, you would be liable to pay GST. A supply is treated as an\nimport of service if the following conditions are satisfied:\n(1) the supplier of service is located outside India;\n(2) the recipient of service is located in India; and\n(3) the place of supply of service is in India.\nThe place of such supply would be taken to be the location where the firm is\nregistered (in GST) and the supplies would attract integrated tax (IGST). The\nfactum of which currency was used to pay the consideration is immaterial.\nQuestion 11: I am an Indian Company who makes software and sells it outside\nthe country. I have hired a firm (not a related party) \u2018C\u2019 located abroad to\nfacilitate the supply of software in Europe and the USA; would I be liable to\npay GST on the payments that I make to this entity abroad?\nAnswer: No. In this case, \u2018C\u2019 is covered by the definition of \u2018intermediary\u2019\n[section 2(13) of the IGST Act, 2017]. The place of supply of such intermediary\nservice is location of the supplier in terms of section 13(8) of the IGST Act,\n2017. As \u2018C\u2019 is located outside India, GST is not payable in this case.\nQuestion 12: What factors determine the location of \u2018C\u2019 (in question 11) as\nbeing outside India?\nAnswer: In terms of section 2(15) of the IGST Act, 2017, the location of a\nservice provider is to be determined by applying the following steps sequentially:\n(1) where a supply is made from a place of business for which the\nregistration has been obtained, the location of such place of business;\n(2) where a supply is made from a place other than the place of business for\nwhich registration has been obtained (a fixed establishment elsewhere),\nthe location of such fixed establishment;\n(3) where a supply is made from more than one establishment, whether the\nplace of business or fixed establishment, the location of the\nestablishment most directly concerned with the provision of the supply;\nand\n(4) in absence of such places, the location of the usual place of residence of\nthe supplier. The location of \u2018C\u2019 is to be determined by applying the criterion from (2), or\n(3), or as the case may be, (4).\nQuestion 13: I am an agent in India of a foreign IT/ITES provider (principal\nlocated outside India). For agency services, I bill the principal in convertible\nforeign exchange. Whether GST liability arises in this case?\nAnswer: You are an intermediary and the place of supply of the service\nprovided by you to the principal is in India irrespective of the mode of payment.\nHence, GST is payable on the services provided by you as an intermediary to the\nprincipal.\nQuestion 14: I have more than one SEZ unit in different States; do I need to\ntake separate registrations? Also, I have two SEZ units in one State. Can I take\na single registration?\nAnswer: (1) Yes. Under GST, every entity shall take GST registration in\neach State from which it makes taxable supplies. However, a single registration\ncan be taken for all your SEZ units within a State, whether located in one SEZ or\nmore than one SEZ.\n(2) A person having unit(s) in a Special Economic Zone as well as outside\nthe SEZ in a State shall make a separate application for registration for SEZ\nunit(s) as a business vertical distinct from his other units located outside the\nSpecial Economic Zone in that State (Refer Rule 8(1) of CGST Rules, 2017).\nQuestion 15: I have a unit in the DTA and another in the SEZ; can I take a\ncommon registration?\nAnswer: No. A person having unit(s) in a Special Economic Zone as well as\noutside the SEZ in a State, shall make a separate application for registration for\nSEZ unit(s) as a business vertical distinct from his other units located outside the\nSpecial Economic Zone in that State (Refer Rule 8(1) of CGST Rules, 2017).\nQuestion 16: If I supply a laptop bag along with the laptop to my customer,\nwhat would be the rate of tax leviable?\nAnswer: If the laptop bag is supplied along with the laptop in the ordinary\ncourse of business, the principal supply is that of the laptop and the bag is an\nancillary. Therefore, it is a composite supply and the rate of tax would that as\napplicable to the laptop.\nQuestion 17: I am obtaining online database access services from a company\nabroad over the net, would I have to pay tax on reverse charge?\nAnswer: The recipient, if registered, has to pay the applicable IGST on\nreverse charge basis. If the recipient is not registered, the matter is treated as an\nonline information and database access or retrieval service (OIDAR) and the\nOIDAR service provider is liable to take registration and pay tax.\nQuestion 18: When would it be construed that I have made a supply of services\ninvolving temporary transfer or permitting the use or enjoyment of any\nintellectual property right?\nAnswer: Generally, the End User Licence Agreement (EULA) is the legal\ncontract between a software application author or publisher and the user of that\napplication governing the usage. The agreement is renewable and/or could be\namended from time to time. To find out as to whether there is an element of\nsupply involved when software is delivered to its customer, the terms and\nconditions of EULA are material.\nThe contract for supply therefore assumes significance in this test to decide\nwhether or not there has been \u2018temporary transfer or permitting the use or\nenjoyment of any intellectual property right\u2019.\nQuestion 19: What special provisions are attracted in GST with regard to\nassociated enterprises?\nAnswer: An enterprise which participates, either directly or indirectly,\nthrough one or more intermediaries, in the management, or control or capital of\nthe other enterprise is an associated enterprise. In the context of GST, associated\nenterprise is particularly relevant in the case of supply of services, where the\nsupplier is located outside India. In such cases, the time of supply will be the\nearlier of date of entry in the books of account of the recipient of supply or the\ndate of payment - thus, within \u2018associated enterprises\u2019, the levy under GST is\nattracted once such book entries are made even if no actual payment takes place\nor no invoice is issued.\nQuestion 20: What would be the tax liability on replacement of parts (no\nconsideration is charged from a customer) under a warranty and whether the\nsupplier is required to reverse the input tax credit?\nAnswer: As parts are provided to the customer without a consideration under\nwarranty, no GST is chargeable on such replacement. The value of supply made\nearlier includes the charges to be incurred during the warranty period. Therefore,\nthe supplier who has undertaken the warranty replacement is not required to\nreverse the input tax credit on the parts/components replaced.\nQuestion 21: An Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) has an obligation\nto provide repair services to their customers in the warranty period. This\nactivity is outsourced by OEM to \u2018D\u2019, who bills the OEM for the services he\nprovides to the customer. What is the tax liability of \u2018D\u2019?\nAnswer: \u2018D\u2019 is providing service to the OEM. GST is payable on the value\nof any supplies made by \u2018D\u2019 to OEM i.e. in respect of bills raised by \u2018D\u2019 on the\nOEM.\nQuestion 22: How will the defective parts be sent to the mother warehouse/\nrepairing centre for repair by the downstream repairing centres? What is the\ntax liability?\nAnswer: The defective parts shall be sent for repair on a delivery challan\naccompanied by such e-way bill as may be prescribed. GST shall be chargeable\non the repair amount, including the cost of parts, charged by the repairing centre.\nQuestion 23: What is the tax liability in a scenario where supplies are made\nfrom multiple locations (in different States) of the supplier to the recipient\nunder a single contract?\nAnswer: Delivering services from various locations and integrated pricing\nfor the contract as a whole is the norm in IT/ITES industry. Normally the\ncontract or agreement with the recipient is entered into by one of the branches\n(let us say \u201cMain Branch\u201d). Therefore, in such cases of service delivery from\nmultiple locations of the supplier to the recipient, the supply could be visualized\nas consisting of two distinct supplies. First supply - the different branches of the\nsupplier located across different States are making the supply to the main branch\nwhich entered into a contact or an agreement with the recipient for the supply of\nsuch service. Second supply - main branch is making a supply to the customer.\nGST is to be levied accordingly. In such a scenario, the main branch would get\ninput tax credit of GST paid by the other branches on supplies made by them to\nthe main branch.\nQuestion 24: In the scenario envisaged in previous question, the main branch\nis said to be entitled to ITC of the GST paid by the other branches. Thus, it is a\nrevenue neutral situation. What are the valuation guidelines for such services?\nAnswer: The second proviso to rule 28 of the CGST Rules, 2017 provides\nthat where the recipient is eligible for full input tax credit, the value declared in\nthe invoice shall be deemed to be the open market value of goods and services.\nQuestion 25: Can payment of IGST on reverse charge basis on import of\ngoods/services be done through book entry or ITC?\nAnswer: No. GST payable on reverse charge basis is to be discharged\nthrough cash only. Rule 85(4) of the CGST Rules, 2017 refers.\nQuestion 26: Is the requirement of transferring of credit through ISD\nmechanism mandatory?\nAnswer: The ISD provision under the CGST Act, 2017 is not mandatory. It\nonly provides the manner of distribution of ITC wherever the business entity\nwishes to distribute the ITC as an Input Service Distributor.\nQuestion 27: What is the format for invoices to be issued in the case of reverse\ncharge payment of GST?\n\nAnswer: No separate format for any type of invoicing including self-\ninvoicing has been prescribed. The contents of the invoice have been prescribed\n\nin Rule 46 of the CGST Rules, 2017.\nQuestion 28: I am a software provider, registered at Mumbai. I supply software\nto my clients in Bangalore - would I be required to take a registration in\nKarnataka?\nAnswer: No. The supplies would be treated as inter-State supplies and IGST\nis chargeable on the same.\nQuestion 29: I am an exporter of services. Would I be entitled to refund after\nthe 1st of July (appointed day)?\nAnswer: For exports upto 30th June, 2017 refund may be claimed under the\nprovisions of the Chapter V of the Finance Act, 1994. Exports made on and after\n1st July would be eligible for refund under the GST law.\nNote: Reference to CGST Act, 2017 includes reference to SGST Act,\n2017 and UTGST Act, 2017 also.\n[Source: C.B.E. & C. website, dated 18-8-2017]\n11.

This requires careful attention in procedural issues such as invoicing, time of supply, place of supply, and ITC credit management to ensure compliance and avoid disputes.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFor the sale or transfer of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR):\n\n- **Permanent Transfer**:\n - **General Goods**: Tax rate of 12% (6% CGST + 6% SGST/IGST)\n - **IT Software**: Tax rate of 18% (9% CGST + 9% SGST/IGST)\n\n- **Temporary Transfer (Licensing)**:\n - **General Goods**: Tax rate of 12% (6% CGST + 6% SGST)\n - **IT Software**: Tax rate of 18% (9% CGST + 9% SGST)\n\nThis classification must be carefully handled to ensure correct application of taxes and compliance with GST requirements, as dual classification presents potential challenges and necessitates clear procedural adherence.\n\nIf any additional specific details or scenarios are required, these must be addressed with further specific context or clarifications from relevant GST notifications and rulings."}
{"input": [{"role": "system", "content": "As an expert legal consultant, provide a detailed response to the question below, considering the given context: 1. Meaning of Liquidated Damages\nThe provision for \u201cLiquidated damages\u201d is a vital clause of any contract or\nagreement between two parties to ensure certain performance within the given\ntime period. It is an advance documented commitment stipulated under contact\nthat in case of any breach of contract or non-performance by the party who\nagreed upon to perform is liable to pay a fixed sum of money and the amount so\nagreed upon and paid by the non-performer or delayed performer is called\nliquidated damages. Sections 73 & 74 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 provides\nfor the consequences of breach of contract and compensation of loss or damages\ncaused by breach of contract.\n2. Liquidated damages vs. unliquidated damages\nWhere the amount of damages can be mathematically calculated as per terms\nand conditions provided in the contract for breach of contract, such amount is\ncalled liquidated damages. In other words where the amount of damages are\nidentified contractually stipulated in the contract for compensation paid to the\nparty, who suffered loss, is called liquidated damages.\nWhere the amount of damages for breach of contract are not identified or\namount is uncertain at the time of contract and does not provide exact amount in\nthe contract for breach by other party is called unliquidated damages. In that case\nthe appropriate court is at discretion to decide the actual compensation with\nregard to the loss suffered.\n3. Liquidated damages in the GST regime\n\u201cSupply\u201d is the taxable event under GST; the levy of tax is based on the\nsupply of goods and services or both. All forms of supply of goods and services\nor both such as sale, transfer, barter, exchange, licence, rental, lease or disposal\nmade or agreed to be made for a consideration by a person in the course of\nbusiness or furtherance of business.\nFurther, it includes the activities to be treated as supply of goods or supply of\nservices as specified in Schedule-II, Entry No.5, Clause (e) of the CGST Act,\n2017, the relevant portion is reproduced as under:\n\u201cagreeing to the obligation to refrain from an act, or to tolerate an act or a\nsituation, or to do an act;\u201d\nThe cited schedule II of the CGST Act, 2017 has been borrowed from the\nprovision of the erstwhile Service Tax Law. Like earlier regime, it is also\ndisputed issue whether mere agreeing to tolerate such an act or situation or\namount imposed for non-performance, which is liquidated damages, is liable to\nlevy of GST?.\n4. Tax rates for liquidated damages (Government Services)\nThe Government has notified the tax liability for Liquidated damages vides\nNotification No. 12/2017-C.T. (Rate), dated 28-06-2017 at Sl. No. 62 under\nHeading No. 9991 or 9997 is reproduced as under:\n\u201cServices provided by the Central Government, State Government,\nUnion territory or local authority by way of tolerating non-performance of a\ncontract for which consideration in the form of fines or liquidated damages is\npayable to the Central Government, State Government, Union territory or\nlocal authority under such contract\u201d.\nTherefore, as per terms of the above Notification, in case liquidated damages\npayable to the Central Government, State Government, Union territory or local\nauthority under a contract, the rate of tax is NIL, i.e., not liable for any tax and\nexempted from GST.\nIn view of the above exemption notification, it appears that liquidated\ndamages payable to the party other than Governments or local authorities will\nattract GST and since no schedule entry is there under the Notification No.\n11/2017-C.T. (Rate) for taxable services of liquidated damages, it would be\ncovered at Sl. No. 35, under Heading 9997 (other services, nowhere else\nclassified) of the said Notification attracting levy of GST @ 18% (9% + 9%).\n\n\n5. C.B.I & C Clarification GST applicability on liquidated damages,\ncompensation and penalty arising out of breach of contract or other\nprovisions of law\nIn certain cases/instances, questions have been raised regarding taxability of\nan activity or transaction as the supply of service of agreeing to the obligation to\nrefrain from an act or to tolerate an act or a situation, or to do an act.\nApplicability of GST on payments in the nature of liquidated damage,\ncompensation, penalty, cancellation charges, late payment surcharge etc. arising\nout of breach of contract or otherwise and scope of the entry at para 5(e) of\nSchedule II of Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 (hereinafter referred to\nas, \u201cCGST Act\u201d) in this context has been examined in the following paragraphs.\n2. \u201cAgreeing to the obligation to refrain from an act or to tolerate an act or a\nsituation, or to do an act\u201d has been specifically declared to be a supply of service\nin para 5 (e) of Schedule II of CGST Act if the same constitutes a \u201csupply\u201d\nwithin the meaning of the Act. The said expression has following three limbs:\n(a) Agreeing to the obligation to refrain from an act.\u2014Example of activities\n\nthat would be covered by this part of the expression would include non-\ncompete agreements, where one party agrees not to compete with the\n\nother party in a product, service or geographical area against a\nconsideration paid by the other party. Another example of such activities\nwould be a builder refraining from constructing more than a certain\nnumber of floors, even though permitted to do so by the municipal\nauthorities, against a compensation paid by the neighbouring housing\nproject, which wants to protect its sunlight, or an industrial unit\nrefraining from manufacturing activity during certain hours against an\nagreed compensation paid by a neighbouring school, which wants to\navoid noise during those hours.\n(b) Agreeing to the obligation to tolerate an act or a situation.\u2014This would\ninclude activities such a shopkeeper allowing a hawker to operate from\nthe common pavement in front of his shop against a monthly payment by\nthe hawker, or an RWA tolerating the use of loud speakers for early\nmorning prayers by a school located in the colony subject to the school\npaying an agreed sum to the RWA as compensation\n(c) Agreeing to the obligation to tolerate an act or a situation.\u2014This would\ninclude activities such a shopkeeper allowing a hawker to operate from\nthe common pavement in front of his shop against a monthly payment by\nthe hawker, or an RWA tolerating the use of loud speakers for early\nmorning prayers by a school located in the colony subject to the school\npaying an agreed sum to the RWA as compensation.\n3. The description \u201cagreeing to the obligation to refrain from an act or to\ntolerate an act or a situation, or to do an act\u201d was intended to cover services such\nas described above. However, over the years doubts have persisted regarding\nvarious transactions being classified under the said description.\n3.1. Some of the important examples of such cases are Service Tax/GST\ndemands on\n(i) Liquidated damages paid for breach of contract;\n(ii) Compensation given to previous allottees of coal blocks for cancellation\nof their licenses pursuant to Supreme Court Order;\n(iii) Cheque dishonour fine/penalty charged by a power distribution company\nfrom the customers;\n(iv) Penalty paid by a mining company to State Government for unaccounted\nstock of river bed material;\n(v) Bond amount recovered from an employee leaving the employment\nbefore the agreed period;\n(vi) Late payment charges collected by any service provider for late payment\nof bills;\n(vii) Fixed charges collected by a power generating company from State\nElectricity Boards (SEBs) or by SEBs/DISCOMs from individual\ncustomer for supply of electricity;\n(viii) Cancellation charges recovered by railways for cancellation of tickets,\netc.\nIn some of these cases, tax authorities have initiated investigation and in\nsome advance ruling authorities have upheld taxability.\n4. In Service Tax law, \u2018Service\u2019 was defined as any activity carried out by a\nperson for another for consideration. As discussed in service tax education guide,\nthe concept \u2018activity for a consideration\u2019 involves an element of contractual\nrelationship wherein the person doing an activity does so at the desire of the\nperson for whom the activity is done in exchange for a consideration. An activity\ndone without such a relationship i.e., without the express or implied contractual\nreciprocity of a consideration would not be an \u2018activity for consideration\u2019. The\nelement of contractual relationship, where one supplies goods or services at the\ndesire or another, is an essential element of supply.\n5. The description of the declared service in question, namely, agreeing to the\nobligation to refrain from an act or to tolerate an act or a situation, or to do an act\nin para 5(e) of Schedule II of CGST Act is strikingly similar to the definition of\ncontract in the Contract Act, 1872. The Contract Act defines \u2018Contract\u2019 as a set\nof promises, forming consideration for each other. \u2018Promise\u2019 has been defined as\nwillingness of the \u2018promisor\u2019 to do or to abstain from doing anything.\n\u2018Consideration\u2019 has been defined in the Contract Act as what the \u2018promisee\u2019 does\nor abstains from doing for the promises made to him.\n6. This goes to show that the service of agreeing to the obligation to refrain\nfrom an act or to tolerate an act or a situation, or to do an act is nothing but a\ncontractual agreement. A contract to do something or to abstain from doing\nsomething cannot be said to have taken place unless there are two parties, one of\nwhich expressly or impliedly agrees to do or abstain from doing something and the other agrees to pay consideration to the first party for doing or abstaining\nfrom such an act. There must be a necessary and sufficient nexus between the\nsupply (i.e. agreement to do or to abstain from doing something) and the\nconsideration.\n6.1 A perusal of the entry at serial 5(e) of Schedule II would reveal that it\ncomprises the aforementioned three different sets of activities viz. (a) the\nobligation to refrain from an act, (b) obligation to tolerate an act or a situation\nand (c) obligation to do an act. All the three activities must be under an\n\u201cagreement\u201d or a \u201ccontract\u201d (whether express or implied) to fall within the ambit\nof the said entry. In other words, one of the parties to such agreement/contract\n(the first party) must be under a contractual obligation to either (a) refrain from\nan act, or (b) to tolerate an act or a situation or (c) to do an act. Further some\n\u201cconsideration\u201d must flow in return from the other party to this contract/\nagreement (the second party) to the first party for such (a) refraining or\n(b) tolerating or (c) doing. Such contractual arrangement must be an independent\narrangement in its own right. Such arrangement or agreement can take the form\nof an independent stand-alone contract or may form part of another contract.\nThus, a person (the first person) can be said to be making a supply by way of\nrefraining from doing something or tolerating some act or situation to another\nperson (the second person) if the first person was under an obligation to do so\nand then performed accordingly.\n5.1 Agreement to do or refrain from an act should not be presumed to exist\n7. There has to be an express or implied agreement; oral or written, to do or\nabstain from doing something against payment of consideration for doing or\nabstaining from such act, for a taxable supply to exist. An agreement to do an act\nor abstain from doing an act or to tolerate an act or a situation cannot be\nimagined or presumed to exist just because there is a flow of money from one\nparty to another. Unless there is an express or implied promise by the recipient of\nmoney to agree to do or abstain from doing something in return for the money\npaid to him, it cannot be assumed that such payment was for doing an act or for\nrefraining from an act or for tolerating an act or situation. Payments such as\nliquidated damages for breach of contract, penalties under the mining act for\nexcess stock found with the mining company, forfeiture of salary or payment of\namount as per the employment bond for leaving the employment before the\nminimum agreed period, penalty for cheque dishonour etc. are not a\nconsideration for tolerating an act or situation. They are rather amounts recovered\nfor not tolerating an act or situation and to deter such acts; such amounts are for\npreventing breach of contract or non-performance and are thus mere \u2018events\u2019 in a\ncontract. Further, such amounts do not constitute payment (or consideration) for\ntolerating an act, because there cannot be any contract: (a) for breach thereof, or\n(b) for holding more stock than permitted under the mining contract, or (c) for\nleaving the employment before the agreed minimum period or (d) for doing\nsomething leading to the dishonour of a cheque. As has already been stated,\nunless payment has been made for an independent activity of tolerating an act under an independent arrangement entered into for such activity of tolerating an\nact, such payments will not constitute \u2018consideration\u2019 and hence such activities\nwill not constitute \u201csupply\u201d within the meaning of the Act. Taxability of these\ntransactions is discussed in greater detail in the following paragraphs.\n5.2 Liquidated Damages\n7.1 Breach or non-performance of contract by one party results in loss and\ndamages to the other party. Therefore, the law provides in Section 73 of the\nContract Act, 1972 that when a contract has been broken, the party which suffers\nby such breach is entitled to receive from the other party compensation for any\nloss or damage caused to him by such breach. The compensation is not by way of\nconsideration for any other independent activity; it is just an event in the course\nof performance of that contract.\n7.1.1.1 It is common for the parties entering into a contract, to specify in the\ncontract itself, the compensation that would be payable in the event of the breach\nof the contract. Such compensation specified in a written contract for breach of\nnon-performance of the contract or parties of the contract is referred to as\nliquidated damages. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u2018Liquidated Damages\u2019 as\ncash compensation agreed to by a signed, written contract for breach of contract,\npayable to the aggrieved party.\n7.1.2 Section 74 of the Contract Act, 1972 provides that when a contract is\nbroken, if a sum has been named or a penalty stipulated in the contract as the\namount or penalty to be paid in case of breach, the aggrieved party shall be\nentitled to receive reasonable compensation not exceeding the amount so named\nor the penalty so stipulated.\n7.1.3 It is argued that performance is the essence of a contract. Liquidated\ndamages cannot be said to be a consideration received for tolerating the breach or\nnon-performance of contract. They are rather payments for not tolerating the\nbreach of contract. Payment of liquidated damages is stipulated in a contract to\nensure performance and to deter non-performance, unsatisfactory performance or\ndelayed performance. Liquidated damages are a measure of loss and damage that\nthe parties agree would arise due to breach of contract. They do not act as a\nremedy for the breach of contract. They do not restitute the aggrieved person. It\nis further argued that a contract is entered into for execution and not for its\nbreach. The liquidated damages or penalty are not the desired outcome of the\ncontract. By accepting the liquidated damages, the party aggrieved by breach of\n\ncontract cannot be said to have permitted or tolerated the deviation or non-\nfulfilment of the promise by the other party.\n\n7.1.4 In this background a reasonable view that can be taken with regard to\ntaxability of liquidated damages is that where the amount paid as \u2018liquidated\ndamages\u2019 is an amount paid only to compensate for injury, loss or damage\nsuffered by the aggrieved party due to breach of the contract and there is no\nagreement, express or implied, by the aggrieved party receiving the liquidated\ndamages, to refrain from or tolerate an act or to do anything for the party paying\nthe liquidated damages, in such cases liquidated damages are mere a flow of money from the party who causes breach of the contract to the party who suffers\nloss or damage due to such breach. Such payments do not constitute\nconsideration for a supply and are not taxable.\n7.1.5 Examples of such cases are damages resulting from damage to\nproperty, negligence, piracy, unauthorized use of trade name, copyright, etc.\nOther examples that may be covered here are the penalty stipulated in a contract\nfor delayed construction of houses. It is a penalty paid by the builder to the\nbuyers to compensate them for the loss that they suffer due to such delayed\nconstruction and not for getting anything in return from the buyers. Similarly,\nforfeiture of earnest money by a seller in case of breach of \u2018an agreement to sell\u2019\nan immovable property by the buyer or by Government or local authority in the\nevent of a successful bidder failing to act after winning the bid, for allotment of\nnatural resources, is a mere flow of money, as the buyer or the successful bidder\ndoes not get anything in return for such forfeiture of earnest money. Forfeiture of\nEarnest money is stipulated in such cases not as a consideration for tolerating the\nbreach of contract but as a compensation for the losses suffered and as a penalty\nfor discouraging the non-serious buyers or bidders. Such payments being merely\nflow of money are not a consideration for any supply and are not taxable. The\nkey in such cases is to consider whether the impugned payments constitute\nconsideration for another independent contract envisaging tolerating an act or\nsituation or refraining from doing any act or situation or simply doing an act. If\nthe answer is yes, then it constitutes a \u2018supply\u2019 within the meaning of the Act,\notherwise it is not a \u201csupply\u201d.\n7.1.6 If a payment constitutes a consideration for a supply, then it is taxable\nirrespective of by what name it is called; it must be remembered that a\n\u201cconsideration\u201d cannot be considered de hors an agreement/contract between two\npersons wherein one person does something for another and that other pays the\nfirst in return. If the payment is merely an event in the course of the performance\nof the agreement and it does not represent the \u2018object\u2019, as such, of the contract\nthen it cannot be considered \u2018consideration\u2019. For example, a contract may\nprovide that payment by the recipient of goods or services shall be made before a\ncertain date and failure to make payment by the due date shall attract late fee or\npenalty. A contract for transport of passengers may stipulate that the ticket\namount shall be partly or wholly forfeited if the passenger does not show up. A\ncontract for package tour may stipulate forfeiture of security deposit in the event\nof cancellation of tour by the customer. Similarly, a contract for lease of movable\nor immovable property may stipulate that the lessee shall not terminate the lease\nbefore a certain period and if he does so he will have to pay certain amount as\nearly termination fee or penalty. Some banks similarly charge pre-payment\npenalty if the borrower wishes to repay the loan before the maturity of the loan\nperiod. Such amounts paid for acceptance of late payment, early termination of\nlease or for pre-payment of loan or the amounts forfeited on cancellation of\nservice by the customer as contemplated by the contract as part of commercial\nterms agreed to by the parties, constitute consideration for the supply of a\nfacility, namely, of acceptance of late payment, early termination of a lease agreement, of pre-payment of loan and of making arrangements for the intended\nsupply by the tour operator respectively. Therefore, such payments, even though\nthey may be referred to as fine or penalty, are actually payments that amount to\nconsideration for supply, and are subject to GST, in cases where such supply is\ntaxable. Since these supplies are ancillary to the principal supply for which the\ncontract is signed, they shall be eligible to be assessed as the principal supply, as\ndiscussed in detail in the later paragraphs. Naturally, such payments will not be\ntaxable if the principal supply is exempt.\n5.3 Compensation for cancellation of coal blocks\n7.2 In the year 2014, coal block/mine allocations were cancelled by the\nHon\u2019ble Supreme Court vide order dated 24.09.2014. Subsequently, Coal Mines\n(Special Provisions) Act, 2015 was enacted to provide for allocation of coal\nmines and vesting of rights, title and interest in and over the land and mines\ninfrastructure together with mining leases to successful bidders and allottees. In\naccordance with section 16 of the said Act, prior (old) allottee of mines were\ngiven compensation in the year 2016 towards the transfer of their rights/titles in\nthe land, mine infrastructure, geological reports, consents, approvals etc. to the\nnew entity (successful bidder) as per the directions of Hon\u2019ble Supreme Court.\n7.2.1 There was no agreement between the prior allottees of coal blocks and\nthe Government that the previous allottees shall agree to or tolerate cancellation\nof the coal blocks allocated to them if the Government pays compensation to\nthem. No such promise or offer was made by the prior allottees to the\nGovernment. The allottees had no option but to accept the cancellation. The\ncompensation was given to them for such cancellation, not under a contract\nbetween the allottees and the Government, but under the provisions of the statute\nand in pursuance of the Supreme Court Order. Therefore, it would be incorrect to\nsay that the prior allottees of the coal blocks supplied a service to the\nGovernment by way of agreeing to tolerate the cancellation of the allocations\nmade to them by the Government or that the compensation paid by the\nGovernment for such cancellation in pursuance to the order of the Supreme Court\nwas a consideration for such service. Therefore, the compensation paid for\ncancellation of coal blocks pursuant to the order of the Supreme Court in the\nabove case was not taxable.\n5.4 Cheque dishonour fine/penalty\n7.3 No supplier wants a cheque given to him to be dis honoured. It entails\nextra administrative cost to him and disruption of his routine activities and cash\nflow. The promise made by any supplier of goods or services is to make supply\nagainst payment within an agreed time (including the agreed permissible time\nwith late payment) through a valid instrument. There is never an implied or\nexpress offer or willingness on part of the supplier that he would tolerate deposit\nof an invalid, fake or unworthy instrument of payment against consideration in\nthe form of cheque dishonour fine or penalty. The fine or penalty that the\nsupplier or a banker imposes, for dishonour of a cheque, is a penalty imposed not\nfor tolerating the act or situation but a fine, or penalty imposed for not tolerating, penalizing and thereby deterring and discouraging such an act or situation.\nTherefore, cheque dishonour fine or penalty is not a consideration for any service\nand not taxable.\n5.5 Penalty imposed for violation of laws\n7.4 Penalty imposed for violation of laws such as traffic violations, or for\nviolation of pollution norms or other laws are also not consideration for any\nsupply received and are not taxable, which are also not taxable. Same is the case\nwith fines, penalties imposed by the mining Department of a Central or State\nGovernment or a local authority on discovering mining of excess mineral beyond\nthe permissible limit or of mining activities in violation of the mining permit.\nSuch penalties imposed for violation of laws cannot be regarded as consideration\ncharged by Government or a Local Authority for tolerating violation of laws.\nLaws are not framed for tolerating their violation. They stipulate penalty not for\ntolerating violation but for not tolerating, penalizing and deterring such\nviolations. There is no agreement between the Government and the violator\nspecifying that violation would be allowed or permitted against payment of fine\nor penalty. There cannot be such an agreement as violation of law is never a\nlawful object or consideration. The service tax education guide issued in 2012 on\nadvent of negative list regime of services explained that fines and penalties paid\nfor violation of provisions of law are not considerations as no service is received\nin lieu of payment of such fines and penalties.\n7.4.1 It was also clarified vide Circular No. 192/02/2016-Service Tax, dated\n13.04.2016 that fines and penalty chargeable by Government or a local authority\nimposed for violation of a statute, bye-laws, rules or regulations are not leviable\nto Service Tax. The same holds true for GST also\n5.6 Forfeiture of salary or payment of bond amount in the event of the\nemployee leaving the employment before the minimum agreed period\n7.5 An employer carries out an elaborate selection process and incurs\nexpenditure in recruiting an employee, invests in his training and makes him a\npart of the organization, privy to its processes and business secrets in the\nexpectation that the recruited employee would work for the organization for a\ncertain minimum period. Premature leaving of the employment results in\ndisruption of work and an undesirable situation. The provisions for forfeiture of\nsalary or recovery of bond amount in the event of the employee leaving the\nemployment before the minimum agreed period are incorporated in the\nemployment contract to discourage non-serious candidates from taking up\nemployment. The said amounts are recovered by the employer not as a\nconsideration for tolerating the act of such premature quitting of employment but\nas penalties for dissuading the non-serious employees from taking up\nemployment and to discourage and deter such a situation. Further, the employee\ndoes not get anything in return from the employer against payment of such\namounts. Therefore, such amounts recovered by the employer are not taxable as\nconsideration for the service of agreeing to tolerate an act or a situation.\n\n5.7 Compensation for not collecting toll charges\n8. In the wake of demonetization, NHAI directed the concessionaires (toll\noperators) to allow free access of toll roads to the users from 8.11.2016 to\n1.12.2016 for which the loss of toll charge was paid as compensation by NHAI as\nper the instructions of Ministry of Road Transportation and Highways. The toll\nreimbursements were calculated based on the average monthly collection of toll.\nA question arose whether the compensation paid to the concessionaire by project\nauthorities (NHAI) in lieu of suspension of toll collection during the\ndemonetization period (from 8.11.2016 to 1.12.2016) was taxable as a service by\nway of agreeing to refrain from collection of toll from users.\n8.1 It has been clarified vide Circular No. 212/2/2019-ST, dated 21.05.2019\nthat the service that is provided by toll operators is that of access to a road or\nbridge, toll charges being merely a consideration for that service. During the\nperiod from 8.11.2016 to 1.12.2016, the service of access to a road or bridge\ncontinued to be provided without collection of toll from users. Consideration\ncame from the project authority. The fact that for this period, for the same\nservice, consideration came from a person other than the actual user of service\ndoes not mean that the service has changed.\n5.8 Late payment surcharge or fee\n9. The facility of accepting late payments with interest or late payment fee,\nfine or penalty is a facility granted by supplier naturally bundled with the main\nsupply. It is not uncommon or unnatural for customers to sometimes miss the last\ndate of payment of electricity, water, telecommunication services etc. Almost all\nservice providers across the world provide the facility of accepting late payments\nwith late fine or penalty. Even if this service is described as a service of\ntolerating the act of late payment, it is an ancillary supply naturally bundled and\nsupplied in conjunction with the principal supply, and therefore should be\nassessed as the principal supply. Since it is ancillary to and naturally bundled\nwith the principal supply such as of electricity, water, telecommunication,\ncooking gas, insurance etc. it should be assessed at the same rate as the principal\nsupply. However, the same cannot be said of cheque dishonor fine or penalty as\ndiscussed in the preceding paragraphs.\n5.9 Fixed Capacity charges for Power\n10. The price charged for electricity by the power generating companies from\nthe State Electricity Boards (SEBs)/DISCOMS or by SEBs/DISCOMs from\nindividual customers has two components, namely, a minimum fixed charge (or\ncapacity charge) and variable per unit charge. The minimum fixed charges have\nto be paid by the SEBs/DISCOMS/individual customers irrespective of the\nquantity of electricity scheduled or purchased by them during a month. They take\ncare of the fixed cost of generating/supplying electricity. The variable charges are\ncharged per unit of electricity purchased and increase or decrease every month\ndepending on the quantity of electricity consumed.\n\n10.1 The fact that the minimum fixed charges remain the same whether\nelectricity is consumed or not or it is scheduled/consumed below the contracted\nor available capacity or a minimum threshold, does not mean that minimum fixed\ncharge or part of it is a charge for tolerating the act of not scheduling or\nconsuming the minimum the contracted or available capacity or a minimum\nthreshold.\n10.2 Both the components of the price, the minimum fixed charges/capacity\ncharges and the variable/energy charges are charged for sale of electricity and are\nthus not taxable as electricity is exempt from GST. Power purchase agreements\nmay have provisions that the power producer shall not supply electricity to a\nthird party without approval of buyer. Such agreements which ensure assured\nsupply of power to State Electricity Boards/DISCOMS are ancillary\narrangements; the contract is essentially for supply of electricity.\n5.10 Cancellation charges\n11. A supply contracted for, such as booking of hotel accommodation, an\nentertainment event or a journey, may be cancelled by a customer or may not\nproceed as intended due to his failure to show up for availing the same at the\ndesignated place and time. The supplier may allow cancelation of supply by the\ncustomer within a certain specified time period on payment of cancellation fee as\nper commercial terms of the contract. In case the customer does not show up for\navailing the service, the supplier may retain or forfeit part of the consideration or\nsecurity deposit or earnest money paid by the customer for the intended supply.\n11.1 It is a common business practice for suppliers of services such as hotel\naccommodation, tour and travel, transportation etc. to provide the facility of\ncancellation of the intended supplies within a certain time period on payment of\ncancellation fee. Cancellation fee can be considered as the charges for the costs\ninvolved in making arrangements for the intended supply and the costs involved\nin cancellation of the supply, such as in cancellation of reserved tickets by the\nIndian Railways.\n11.2 Services such as transportation travel and tour constitute a bundle of\nservices. The transportation service, for instance, starts with booking of the ticket\nfor travel and lasts at least till exit of the passenger from the destination terminal.\nAll services such as making available an online portal or convenient booking\ncounters with basic facilities at the transportation terminal or in the city, to\nreserve the seats and issue tickets for reserved seats much in advance of the\ntravel, giving preferred seats with or without extra cost, lounge and waiting room\nfacilities at airports, railway stations and bus terminals, provision of basic\nnecessities such as soap and other toiletries in the wash rooms, clean drinking\nwater in the waiting area etc. form part and parcel of the transportation service;\nthey constitute the various elements of passenger transportation service, a\ncomposite supply. The facilitation service of allowing cancellation against\npayment of cancellation charges is also a natural part of this bundle. It is\ninvariably supplied by all suppliers of passenger transportation service as"}, {"role": "user", "content": "What is the taxability under GST in case of liquidated damages"}], "ideal": "**1. Meaning:**\nLiquidated damages refer to a predetermined sum agreed upon within a contract to be paid if one of the parties breaches the terms of the contract. These damages compensate the aggrieved party for losses caused by such breaches.\n\n**2. Classification:**\nThey differ from unliquidated damages, where the compensation for breach is not specified in the contract and must be determined by the court.\n\n### Taxability Under GST\n\n**3. GST Regime:**\nIn the GST framework, \"supply\" covers a wide range of activities, including the agreement to tolerate an act or refrain from an act as per Schedule II, Entry No. 5(e) of the CGST Act, 2017.\n\n**4. Tax Rates for Liquidated Damages (Government Services):**\nThe tax rate for liquidated damages levied by the Central Government, State Government, Union Territory, or local authority is exempt under Notification No. 12/2017-C.T. (Rate). This implies these instances are not liable for GST.\n\n### C.B.I. & C Clarification and Circular No. 178/10/2022-GST\n\n**5. Clarification on Applicability:**\nThe taxability of liquidated damages hinges on whether they are considered a \"supply\" under GST:\n- If the payment of liquidated damages is seen purely as compensation for loss or damage due to breach without any implied agreement to tolerate or refrain from an act, it is not treated as a supply and, hence, not taxable.\n- If there is an agreement to tolerate an act (e.g., delayed performance) against consideration, it constitutes a supply and is taxable under GST.\n\n**6. Examples of Non-Taxable Liquidated Damages:**\n- Damages for delayed construction paid by a builder to buyers.\n- Forfeiture of earnest money by a seller in a breach of an agreement to sell immovable property where the buyer gets nothing in return.\n- Penalty for cheque dishonour or other violations of law.\n\n**7. Relevant Judicial Pronouncements:**\n- **Maharashtra State Power Generation Company Limited (2018)**:\n Imposing liquidated damages for delay in project completion was considered a taxable activity under GST as it constituted tolerating an act in return for compensation.\n- **Bajaj Finance Limited (2018)**:\n Penal charges for loan defaults were held taxable under GST, interpreted as consideration for tolerating the default.\n- **Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd (2020)** and **Haryana State Warehousing Corporation (2021)**:\n Similar rulings endorsed that such payments are taxable where they are seen as the consideration for tolerating a situation or act.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the contexts provided, liquidated damages are generally taxable under GST when seen as consideration for tolerating an act or situation per contractual obligations. However, if they are purely compensatory for losses without any reciprocal tolerance or activity, they are not taxable. The specific cases and individual contractual terms play a crucial role in determining the taxability under GST."}
{"input": [{"role": "system", "content": "As an expert legal consultant, provide a detailed response to the question below, considering the given context: 1. Meaning of Liquidated Damages\nThe provision for \u201cLiquidated damages\u201d is a vital clause of any contract or\nagreement between two parties to ensure certain performance within the given\ntime period. It is an advance documented commitment stipulated under contact\nthat in case of any breach of contract or non-performance by the party who\nagreed upon to perform is liable to pay a fixed sum of money and the amount so\nagreed upon and paid by the non-performer or delayed performer is called\nliquidated damages. Sections 73 & 74 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 provides\nfor the consequences of breach of contract and compensation of loss or damages\ncaused by breach of contract.\n2. Liquidated damages vs. unliquidated damages\nWhere the amount of damages can be mathematically calculated as per terms\nand conditions provided in the contract for breach of contract, such amount is\ncalled liquidated damages. In other words where the amount of damages are\nidentified contractually stipulated in the contract for compensation paid to the\nparty, who suffered loss, is called liquidated damages.\nWhere the amount of damages for breach of contract are not identified or\namount is uncertain at the time of contract and does not provide exact amount in\nthe contract for breach by other party is called unliquidated damages. In that case\nthe appropriate court is at discretion to decide the actual compensation with\nregard to the loss suffered.\n3. Liquidated damages in the GST regime\n\u201cSupply\u201d is the taxable event under GST; the levy of tax is based on the\nsupply of goods and services or both. All forms of supply of goods and services\nor both such as sale, transfer, barter, exchange, licence, rental, lease or disposal\nmade or agreed to be made for a consideration by a person in the course of\nbusiness or furtherance of business.\nFurther, it includes the activities to be treated as supply of goods or supply of\nservices as specified in Schedule-II, Entry No.5, Clause (e) of the CGST Act,\n2017, the relevant portion is reproduced as under:\n\u201cagreeing to the obligation to refrain from an act, or to tolerate an act or a\nsituation, or to do an act;\u201d\nThe cited schedule II of the CGST Act, 2017 has been borrowed from the\nprovision of the erstwhile Service Tax Law. Like earlier regime, it is also\ndisputed issue whether mere agreeing to tolerate such an act or situation or\namount imposed for non-performance, which is liquidated damages, is liable to\nlevy of GST?.\n4. Tax rates for liquidated damages (Government Services)\nThe Government has notified the tax liability for Liquidated damages vides\nNotification No. 12/2017-C.T. (Rate), dated 28-06-2017 at Sl. No. 62 under\nHeading No. 9991 or 9997 is reproduced as under:\n\u201cServices provided by the Central Government, State Government,\nUnion territory or local authority by way of tolerating non-performance of a\ncontract for which consideration in the form of fines or liquidated damages is\npayable to the Central Government, State Government, Union territory or\nlocal authority under such contract\u201d.\nTherefore, as per terms of the above Notification, in case liquidated damages\npayable to the Central Government, State Government, Union territory or local\nauthority under a contract, the rate of tax is NIL, i.e., not liable for any tax and\nexempted from GST.\nIn view of the above exemption notification, it appears that liquidated\ndamages payable to the party other than Governments or local authorities will\nattract GST and since no schedule entry is there under the Notification No.\n11/2017-C.T. (Rate) for taxable services of liquidated damages, it would be\ncovered at Sl. No. 35, under Heading 9997 (other services, nowhere else\nclassified) of the said Notification attracting levy of GST @ 18% (9% + 9%).\n\n\n5. C.B.I & C Clarification GST applicability on liquidated damages,\ncompensation and penalty arising out of breach of contract or other\nprovisions of law\nIn certain cases/instances, questions have been raised regarding taxability of\nan activity or transaction as the supply of service of agreeing to the obligation to\nrefrain from an act or to tolerate an act or a situation, or to do an act.\nApplicability of GST on payments in the nature of liquidated damage,\ncompensation, penalty, cancellation charges, late payment surcharge etc. arising\nout of breach of contract or otherwise and scope of the entry at para 5(e) of\nSchedule II of Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 (hereinafter referred to\nas, \u201cCGST Act\u201d) in this context has been examined in the following paragraphs.\n2. \u201cAgreeing to the obligation to refrain from an act or to tolerate an act or a\nsituation, or to do an act\u201d has been specifically declared to be a supply of service\nin para 5 (e) of Schedule II of CGST Act if the same constitutes a \u201csupply\u201d\nwithin the meaning of the Act. The said expression has following three limbs:\n(a) Agreeing to the obligation to refrain from an act.\u2014Example of activities\n\nthat would be covered by this part of the expression would include non-\ncompete agreements, where one party agrees not to compete with the\n\nother party in a product, service or geographical area against a\nconsideration paid by the other party. Another example of such activities\nwould be a builder refraining from constructing more than a certain\nnumber of floors, even though permitted to do so by the municipal\nauthorities, against a compensation paid by the neighbouring housing\nproject, which wants to protect its sunlight, or an industrial unit\nrefraining from manufacturing activity during certain hours against an\nagreed compensation paid by a neighbouring school, which wants to\navoid noise during those hours.\n(b) Agreeing to the obligation to tolerate an act or a situation.\u2014This would\ninclude activities such a shopkeeper allowing a hawker to operate from\nthe common pavement in front of his shop against a monthly payment by\nthe hawker, or an RWA tolerating the use of loud speakers for early\nmorning prayers by a school located in the colony subject to the school\npaying an agreed sum to the RWA as compensation\n(c) Agreeing to the obligation to tolerate an act or a situation.\u2014This would\ninclude activities such a shopkeeper allowing a hawker to operate from\nthe common pavement in front of his shop against a monthly payment by\nthe hawker, or an RWA tolerating the use of loud speakers for early\nmorning prayers by a school located in the colony subject to the school\npaying an agreed sum to the RWA as compensation.\n3. The description \u201cagreeing to the obligation to refrain from an act or to\ntolerate an act or a situation, or to do an act\u201d was intended to cover services such\nas described above. However, over the years doubts have persisted regarding\nvarious transactions being classified under the said description.\n3.1. Some of the important examples of such cases are Service Tax/GST\ndemands on\n(i) Liquidated damages paid for breach of contract;\n(ii) Compensation given to previous allottees of coal blocks for cancellation\nof their licenses pursuant to Supreme Court Order;\n(iii) Cheque dishonour fine/penalty charged by a power distribution company\nfrom the customers;\n(iv) Penalty paid by a mining company to State Government for unaccounted\nstock of river bed material;\n(v) Bond amount recovered from an employee leaving the employment\nbefore the agreed period;\n(vi) Late payment charges collected by any service provider for late payment\nof bills;\n(vii) Fixed charges collected by a power generating company from State\nElectricity Boards (SEBs) or by SEBs/DISCOMs from individual\ncustomer for supply of electricity;\n(viii) Cancellation charges recovered by railways for cancellation of tickets,\netc.\nIn some of these cases, tax authorities have initiated investigation and in\nsome advance ruling authorities have upheld taxability.\n4. In Service Tax law, \u2018Service\u2019 was defined as any activity carried out by a\nperson for another for consideration. As discussed in service tax education guide,\nthe concept \u2018activity for a consideration\u2019 involves an element of contractual\nrelationship wherein the person doing an activity does so at the desire of the\nperson for whom the activity is done in exchange for a consideration. An activity\ndone without such a relationship i.e., without the express or implied contractual\nreciprocity of a consideration would not be an \u2018activity for consideration\u2019. The\nelement of contractual relationship, where one supplies goods or services at the\ndesire or another, is an essential element of supply.\n5. The description of the declared service in question, namely, agreeing to the\nobligation to refrain from an act or to tolerate an act or a situation, or to do an act\nin para 5(e) of Schedule II of CGST Act is strikingly similar to the definition of\ncontract in the Contract Act, 1872. The Contract Act defines \u2018Contract\u2019 as a set\nof promises, forming consideration for each other. \u2018Promise\u2019 has been defined as\nwillingness of the \u2018promisor\u2019 to do or to abstain from doing anything.\n\u2018Consideration\u2019 has been defined in the Contract Act as what the \u2018promisee\u2019 does\nor abstains from doing for the promises made to him.\n6. This goes to show that the service of agreeing to the obligation to refrain\nfrom an act or to tolerate an act or a situation, or to do an act is nothing but a\ncontractual agreement. A contract to do something or to abstain from doing\nsomething cannot be said to have taken place unless there are two parties, one of\nwhich expressly or impliedly agrees to do or abstain from doing something and the other agrees to pay consideration to the first party for doing or abstaining\nfrom such an act. There must be a necessary and sufficient nexus between the\nsupply (i.e. agreement to do or to abstain from doing something) and the\nconsideration.\n6.1 A perusal of the entry at serial 5(e) of Schedule II would reveal that it\ncomprises the aforementioned three different sets of activities viz. (a) the\nobligation to refrain from an act, (b) obligation to tolerate an act or a situation\nand (c) obligation to do an act. All the three activities must be under an\n\u201cagreement\u201d or a \u201ccontract\u201d (whether express or implied) to fall within the ambit\nof the said entry. In other words, one of the parties to such agreement/contract\n(the first party) must be under a contractual obligation to either (a) refrain from\nan act, or (b) to tolerate an act or a situation or (c) to do an act. Further some\n\u201cconsideration\u201d must flow in return from the other party to this contract/\nagreement (the second party) to the first party for such (a) refraining or\n(b) tolerating or (c) doing. Such contractual arrangement must be an independent\narrangement in its own right. Such arrangement or agreement can take the form\nof an independent stand-alone contract or may form part of another contract.\nThus, a person (the first person) can be said to be making a supply by way of\nrefraining from doing something or tolerating some act or situation to another\nperson (the second person) if the first person was under an obligation to do so\nand then performed accordingly.\n5.1 Agreement to do or refrain from an act should not be presumed to exist\n7. There has to be an express or implied agreement; oral or written, to do or\nabstain from doing something against payment of consideration for doing or\nabstaining from such act, for a taxable supply to exist. An agreement to do an act\nor abstain from doing an act or to tolerate an act or a situation cannot be\nimagined or presumed to exist just because there is a flow of money from one\nparty to another. Unless there is an express or implied promise by the recipient of\nmoney to agree to do or abstain from doing something in return for the money\npaid to him, it cannot be assumed that such payment was for doing an act or for\nrefraining from an act or for tolerating an act or situation. Payments such as\nliquidated damages for breach of contract, penalties under the mining act for\nexcess stock found with the mining company, forfeiture of salary or payment of\namount as per the employment bond for leaving the employment before the\nminimum agreed period, penalty for cheque dishonour etc. are not a\nconsideration for tolerating an act or situation. They are rather amounts recovered\nfor not tolerating an act or situation and to deter such acts; such amounts are for\npreventing breach of contract or non-performance and are thus mere \u2018events\u2019 in a\ncontract. Further, such amounts do not constitute payment (or consideration) for\ntolerating an act, because there cannot be any contract: (a) for breach thereof, or\n(b) for holding more stock than permitted under the mining contract, or (c) for\nleaving the employment before the agreed minimum period or (d) for doing\nsomething leading to the dishonour of a cheque. As has already been stated,\nunless payment has been made for an independent activity of tolerating an act under an independent arrangement entered into for such activity of tolerating an\nact, such payments will not constitute \u2018consideration\u2019 and hence such activities\nwill not constitute \u201csupply\u201d within the meaning of the Act. Taxability of these\ntransactions is discussed in greater detail in the following paragraphs.\n5.2 Liquidated Damages\n7.1 Breach or non-performance of contract by one party results in loss and\ndamages to the other party. Therefore, the law provides in Section 73 of the\nContract Act, 1972 that when a contract has been broken, the party which suffers\nby such breach is entitled to receive from the other party compensation for any\nloss or damage caused to him by such breach. The compensation is not by way of\nconsideration for any other independent activity; it is just an event in the course\nof performance of that contract.\n7.1.1.1 It is common for the parties entering into a contract, to specify in the\ncontract itself, the compensation that would be payable in the event of the breach\nof the contract. Such compensation specified in a written contract for breach of\nnon-performance of the contract or parties of the contract is referred to as\nliquidated damages. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u2018Liquidated Damages\u2019 as\ncash compensation agreed to by a signed, written contract for breach of contract,\npayable to the aggrieved party.\n7.1.2 Section 74 of the Contract Act, 1972 provides that when a contract is\nbroken, if a sum has been named or a penalty stipulated in the contract as the\namount or penalty to be paid in case of breach, the aggrieved party shall be\nentitled to receive reasonable compensation not exceeding the amount so named\nor the penalty so stipulated.\n7.1.3 It is argued that performance is the essence of a contract. Liquidated\ndamages cannot be said to be a consideration received for tolerating the breach or\nnon-performance of contract. They are rather payments for not tolerating the\nbreach of contract. Payment of liquidated damages is stipulated in a contract to\nensure performance and to deter non-performance, unsatisfactory performance or\ndelayed performance. Liquidated damages are a measure of loss and damage that\nthe parties agree would arise due to breach of contract. They do not act as a\nremedy for the breach of contract. They do not restitute the aggrieved person. It\nis further argued that a contract is entered into for execution and not for its\nbreach. The liquidated damages or penalty are not the desired outcome of the\ncontract. By accepting the liquidated damages, the party aggrieved by breach of\n\ncontract cannot be said to have permitted or tolerated the deviation or non-\nfulfilment of the promise by the other party.\n\n7.1.4 In this background a reasonable view that can be taken with regard to\ntaxability of liquidated damages is that where the amount paid as \u2018liquidated\ndamages\u2019 is an amount paid only to compensate for injury, loss or damage\nsuffered by the aggrieved party due to breach of the contract and there is no\nagreement, express or implied, by the aggrieved party receiving the liquidated\ndamages, to refrain from or tolerate an act or to do anything for the party paying\nthe liquidated damages, in such cases liquidated damages are mere a flow of money from the party who causes breach of the contract to the party who suffers\nloss or damage due to such breach. Such payments do not constitute\nconsideration for a supply and are not taxable.\n7.1.5 Examples of such cases are damages resulting from damage to\nproperty, negligence, piracy, unauthorized use of trade name, copyright, etc.\nOther examples that may be covered here are the penalty stipulated in a contract\nfor delayed construction of houses. It is a penalty paid by the builder to the\nbuyers to compensate them for the loss that they suffer due to such delayed\nconstruction and not for getting anything in return from the buyers. Similarly,\nforfeiture of earnest money by a seller in case of breach of \u2018an agreement to sell\u2019\nan immovable property by the buyer or by Government or local authority in the\nevent of a successful bidder failing to act after winning the bid, for allotment of\nnatural resources, is a mere flow of money, as the buyer or the successful bidder\ndoes not get anything in return for such forfeiture of earnest money. Forfeiture of\nEarnest money is stipulated in such cases not as a consideration for tolerating the\nbreach of contract but as a compensation for the losses suffered and as a penalty\nfor discouraging the non-serious buyers or bidders. Such payments being merely\nflow of money are not a consideration for any supply and are not taxable. The\nkey in such cases is to consider whether the impugned payments constitute\nconsideration for another independent contract envisaging tolerating an act or\nsituation or refraining from doing any act or situation or simply doing an act. If\nthe answer is yes, then it constitutes a \u2018supply\u2019 within the meaning of the Act,\notherwise it is not a \u201csupply\u201d.\n7.1.6 If a payment constitutes a consideration for a supply, then it is taxable\nirrespective of by what name it is called; it must be remembered that a\n\u201cconsideration\u201d cannot be considered de hors an agreement/contract between two\npersons wherein one person does something for another and that other pays the\nfirst in return. If the payment is merely an event in the course of the performance\nof the agreement and it does not represent the \u2018object\u2019, as such, of the contract\nthen it cannot be considered \u2018consideration\u2019. For example, a contract may\nprovide that payment by the recipient of goods or services shall be made before a\ncertain date and failure to make payment by the due date shall attract late fee or\npenalty. A contract for transport of passengers may stipulate that the ticket\namount shall be partly or wholly forfeited if the passenger does not show up. A\ncontract for package tour may stipulate forfeiture of security deposit in the event\nof cancellation of tour by the customer. Similarly, a contract for lease of movable\nor immovable property may stipulate that the lessee shall not terminate the lease\nbefore a certain period and if he does so he will have to pay certain amount as\nearly termination fee or penalty. Some banks similarly charge pre-payment\npenalty if the borrower wishes to repay the loan before the maturity of the loan\nperiod. Such amounts paid for acceptance of late payment, early termination of\nlease or for pre-payment of loan or the amounts forfeited on cancellation of\nservice by the customer as contemplated by the contract as part of commercial\nterms agreed to by the parties, constitute consideration for the supply of a\nfacility, namely, of acceptance of late payment, early termination of a lease agreement, of pre-payment of loan and of making arrangements for the intended\nsupply by the tour operator respectively. Therefore, such payments, even though\nthey may be referred to as fine or penalty, are actually payments that amount to\nconsideration for supply, and are subject to GST, in cases where such supply is\ntaxable. Since these supplies are ancillary to the principal supply for which the\ncontract is signed, they shall be eligible to be assessed as the principal supply, as\ndiscussed in detail in the later paragraphs. Naturally, such payments will not be\ntaxable if the principal supply is exempt.\n5.3 Compensation for cancellation of coal blocks\n7.2 In the year 2014, coal block/mine allocations were cancelled by the\nHon\u2019ble Supreme Court vide order dated 24.09.2014. Subsequently, Coal Mines\n(Special Provisions) Act, 2015 was enacted to provide for allocation of coal\nmines and vesting of rights, title and interest in and over the land and mines\ninfrastructure together with mining leases to successful bidders and allottees. In\naccordance with section 16 of the said Act, prior (old) allottee of mines were\ngiven compensation in the year 2016 towards the transfer of their rights/titles in\nthe land, mine infrastructure, geological reports, consents, approvals etc. to the\nnew entity (successful bidder) as per the directions of Hon\u2019ble Supreme Court.\n7.2.1 There was no agreement between the prior allottees of coal blocks and\nthe Government that the previous allottees shall agree to or tolerate cancellation\nof the coal blocks allocated to them if the Government pays compensation to\nthem. No such promise or offer was made by the prior allottees to the\nGovernment. The allottees had no option but to accept the cancellation. The\ncompensation was given to them for such cancellation, not under a contract\nbetween the allottees and the Government, but under the provisions of the statute\nand in pursuance of the Supreme Court Order. Therefore, it would be incorrect to\nsay that the prior allottees of the coal blocks supplied a service to the\nGovernment by way of agreeing to tolerate the cancellation of the allocations\nmade to them by the Government or that the compensation paid by the\nGovernment for such cancellation in pursuance to the order of the Supreme Court\nwas a consideration for such service. Therefore, the compensation paid for\ncancellation of coal blocks pursuant to the order of the Supreme Court in the\nabove case was not taxable.\n5.4 Cheque dishonour fine/penalty\n7.3 No supplier wants a cheque given to him to be dis honoured. It entails\nextra administrative cost to him and disruption of his routine activities and cash\nflow. The promise made by any supplier of goods or services is to make supply\nagainst payment within an agreed time (including the agreed permissible time\nwith late payment) through a valid instrument. There is never an implied or\nexpress offer or willingness on part of the supplier that he would tolerate deposit\nof an invalid, fake or unworthy instrument of payment against consideration in\nthe form of cheque dishonour fine or penalty. The fine or penalty that the\nsupplier or a banker imposes, for dishonour of a cheque, is a penalty imposed not\nfor tolerating the act or situation but a fine, or penalty imposed for not tolerating, penalizing and thereby deterring and discouraging such an act or situation.\nTherefore, cheque dishonour fine or penalty is not a consideration for any service\nand not taxable.\n5.5 Penalty imposed for violation of laws\n7.4 Penalty imposed for violation of laws such as traffic violations, or for\nviolation of pollution norms or other laws are also not consideration for any\nsupply received and are not taxable, which are also not taxable. Same is the case\nwith fines, penalties imposed by the mining Department of a Central or State\nGovernment or a local authority on discovering mining of excess mineral beyond\nthe permissible limit or of mining activities in violation of the mining permit.\nSuch penalties imposed for violation of laws cannot be regarded as consideration\ncharged by Government or a Local Authority for tolerating violation of laws.\nLaws are not framed for tolerating their violation. They stipulate penalty not for\ntolerating violation but for not tolerating, penalizing and deterring such\nviolations. There is no agreement between the Government and the violator\nspecifying that violation would be allowed or permitted against payment of fine\nor penalty. There cannot be such an agreement as violation of law is never a\nlawful object or consideration. The service tax education guide issued in 2012 on\nadvent of negative list regime of services explained that fines and penalties paid\nfor violation of provisions of law are not considerations as no service is received\nin lieu of payment of such fines and penalties.\n7.4.1 It was also clarified vide Circular No. 192/02/2016-Service Tax, dated\n13.04.2016 that fines and penalty chargeable by Government or a local authority\nimposed for violation of a statute, bye-laws, rules or regulations are not leviable\nto Service Tax. The same holds true for GST also\n5.6 Forfeiture of salary or payment of bond amount in the event of the\nemployee leaving the employment before the minimum agreed period\n7.5 An employer carries out an elaborate selection process and incurs\nexpenditure in recruiting an employee, invests in his training and makes him a\npart of the organization, privy to its processes and business secrets in the\nexpectation that the recruited employee would work for the organization for a\ncertain minimum period. Premature leaving of the employment results in\ndisruption of work and an undesirable situation. The provisions for forfeiture of\nsalary or recovery of bond amount in the event of the employee leaving the\nemployment before the minimum agreed period are incorporated in the\nemployment contract to discourage non-serious candidates from taking up\nemployment. The said amounts are recovered by the employer not as a\nconsideration for tolerating the act of such premature quitting of employment but\nas penalties for dissuading the non-serious employees from taking up\nemployment and to discourage and deter such a situation. Further, the employee\ndoes not get anything in return from the employer against payment of such\namounts. Therefore, such amounts recovered by the employer are not taxable as\nconsideration for the service of agreeing to tolerate an act or a situation.\n\n5.7 Compensation for not collecting toll charges\n8. In the wake of demonetization, NHAI directed the concessionaires (toll\noperators) to allow free access of toll roads to the users from 8.11.2016 to\n1.12.2016 for which the loss of toll charge was paid as compensation by NHAI as\nper the instructions of Ministry of Road Transportation and Highways. The toll\nreimbursements were calculated based on the average monthly collection of toll.\nA question arose whether the compensation paid to the concessionaire by project\nauthorities (NHAI) in lieu of suspension of toll collection during the\ndemonetization period (from 8.11.2016 to 1.12.2016) was taxable as a service by\nway of agreeing to refrain from collection of toll from users.\n8.1 It has been clarified vide Circular No. 212/2/2019-ST, dated 21.05.2019\nthat the service that is provided by toll operators is that of access to a road or\nbridge, toll charges being merely a consideration for that service. During the\nperiod from 8.11.2016 to 1.12.2016, the service of access to a road or bridge\ncontinued to be provided without collection of toll from users. Consideration\ncame from the project authority. The fact that for this period, for the same\nservice, consideration came from a person other than the actual user of service\ndoes not mean that the service has changed.\n5.8 Late payment surcharge or fee\n9. The facility of accepting late payments with interest or late payment fee,\nfine or penalty is a facility granted by supplier naturally bundled with the main\nsupply. It is not uncommon or unnatural for customers to sometimes miss the last\ndate of payment of electricity, water, telecommunication services etc. Almost all\nservice providers across the world provide the facility of accepting late payments\nwith late fine or penalty. Even if this service is described as a service of\ntolerating the act of late payment, it is an ancillary supply naturally bundled and\nsupplied in conjunction with the principal supply, and therefore should be\nassessed as the principal supply. Since it is ancillary to and naturally bundled\nwith the principal supply such as of electricity, water, telecommunication,\ncooking gas, insurance etc. it should be assessed at the same rate as the principal\nsupply. However, the same cannot be said of cheque dishonor fine or penalty as\ndiscussed in the preceding paragraphs.\n5.9 Fixed Capacity charges for Power\n10. The price charged for electricity by the power generating companies from\nthe State Electricity Boards (SEBs)/DISCOMS or by SEBs/DISCOMs from\nindividual customers has two components, namely, a minimum fixed charge (or\ncapacity charge) and variable per unit charge. The minimum fixed charges have\nto be paid by the SEBs/DISCOMS/individual customers irrespective of the\nquantity of electricity scheduled or purchased by them during a month. They take\ncare of the fixed cost of generating/supplying electricity. The variable charges are\ncharged per unit of electricity purchased and increase or decrease every month\ndepending on the quantity of electricity consumed.\n\n10.1 The fact that the minimum fixed charges remain the same whether\nelectricity is consumed or not or it is scheduled/consumed below the contracted\nor available capacity or a minimum threshold, does not mean that minimum fixed\ncharge or part of it is a charge for tolerating the act of not scheduling or\nconsuming the minimum the contracted or available capacity or a minimum\nthreshold.\n10.2 Both the components of the price, the minimum fixed charges/capacity\ncharges and the variable/energy charges are charged for sale of electricity and are\nthus not taxable as electricity is exempt from GST. Power purchase agreements\nmay have provisions that the power producer shall not supply electricity to a\nthird party without approval of buyer. Such agreements which ensure assured\nsupply of power to State Electricity Boards/DISCOMS are ancillary\narrangements; the contract is essentially for supply of electricity.\n5.10 Cancellation charges\n11. A supply contracted for, such as booking of hotel accommodation, an\nentertainment event or a journey, may be cancelled by a customer or may not\nproceed as intended due to his failure to show up for availing the same at the\ndesignated place and time. The supplier may allow cancelation of supply by the\ncustomer within a certain specified time period on payment of cancellation fee as\nper commercial terms of the contract. In case the customer does not show up for\navailing the service, the supplier may retain or forfeit part of the consideration or\nsecurity deposit or earnest money paid by the customer for the intended supply.\n11.1 It is a common business practice for suppliers of services such as hotel\naccommodation, tour and travel, transportation etc. to provide the facility of\ncancellation of the intended supplies within a certain time period on payment of\ncancellation fee. Cancellation fee can be considered as the charges for the costs\ninvolved in making arrangements for the intended supply and the costs involved\nin cancellation of the supply, such as in cancellation of reserved tickets by the\nIndian Railways.\n11.2 Services such as transportation travel and tour constitute a bundle of\nservices. The transportation service, for instance, starts with booking of the ticket\nfor travel and lasts at least till exit of the passenger from the destination terminal.\nAll services such as making available an online portal or convenient booking\ncounters with basic facilities at the transportation terminal or in the city, to\nreserve the seats and issue tickets for reserved seats much in advance of the\ntravel, giving preferred seats with or without extra cost, lounge and waiting room\nfacilities at airports, railway stations and bus terminals, provision of basic\nnecessities such as soap and other toiletries in the wash rooms, clean drinking\nwater in the waiting area etc. form part and parcel of the transportation service;\nthey constitute the various elements of passenger transportation service, a\ncomposite supply. The facilitation service of allowing cancellation against\npayment of cancellation charges is also a natural part of this bundle. It is\ninvariably supplied by all suppliers of passenger transportation service as"}, {"role": "user", "content": "What is the taxability under GST in case of liquidated damages"}], "ideal": "**1.

{"input": [{"role": "system", "content": "As an expert legal consultant, provide a detailed response to the question below, considering the given context: Departmental Clarification\nCircular No. 140/10/2020-GST, dated 10.06.2020\nSubject: Clarification in respect of levy of GST on Director\u2019s remuneration \u2014 Reg.\nVarious references have been received from trade and industry seeking clarification whether the GST\nis leviable on Director\u2019s remuneration paid by companies to their directors. Doubts have been raised as to whether the remuneration paid by companies to their directors falls under the ambit of entry in\nSchedule III of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 (hereinafter referred to as the CGST\nAct) i.e. \u201cservices by an employee to the employer in the course of or in relation to his employment\u201d or\nwhether the same are liable to be taxed in terms of notification No. 13/2017-Central Tax (Rate) dated\n28.06.2017 (entry no. 6).\n2. The issue of remuneration to directors has been examined under following two different categories:\n(i) leviability of GST on remuneration paid by companies to the independent directors defined in\nterms of section 149(6) of the Companies Act, 2013 or those directors who are not the employees\nof the said company; and\n(ii) leviability of GST on remuneration paid by companies to the whole-time directors including\nmanaging director who are employees of the said company.\n3. In order to ensure uniformity in the implementation of the provisions of the law across the field\nformations, the Board, in exercise of its powers conferred under section 168(1) of the CGST Act\nhereby clarifies the issue as below:\nLeviability of GST on remuneration paid by companies to the independent directors or those\ndirectors who are not the employee of the said company\n4.1 The primary issue to be decided is whether or not a \u201cDirector\u2019 is an employee of the company. In\nthis regard, from the perusal of the relevant provisions of the Companies Act, 2013, it can be inferred\nthat:\n(a) the definition of a whole time-director under section 2(94) of the Companies Act, 2013 is an\ninclusive definition, and thus he may be a person who is not an employee of the company.\n(b) the definition of \u201cindependent directors\u2019 under section 149(6) of the Companies Act, 2013, read\nwith Rule 12 of Companies (Share Capital and Debentures) Rules, 2014 makes it amply clear that\nsuch director should not have been an employee or proprietor or a partner of the said company, in\nany of the three financial years immediately preceding the financial year in which he is proposed\nto be appointed in the said company.\n4.2 Therefore, in respect of such directors who are not the employees of the said company, the services\nprovided by them to the Company, in lieu of remuneration as the consideration for the said services,\nare clearly outside the scope of Schedule III of the CGST Act and are therefore taxable. In terms of\nentry at Sl. No. 6 of the Table annexed to Notification No. 13/2017-Central Tax (Rate), dated\n28.06.2017, the recipient of the said services i.e. the Company, is liable to discharge the applicable\nGST on it on reverse charge basis.\n4.3 Accordingly, it is hereby clarified that the remuneration paid to such independent directors, or\nthose directors, by whatever name called, who are not employees of the said company, is taxable in\nhands of the company, on reverse charge basis.\nLeviability of GST on remuneration paid by companies to the directors, who are also an\nemployee of the said company\n5.1 Once, it has been ascertained whether a director, irrespective of name and designation, is an\nemployee, it would be pertinent to examine whether all the activities performed by the director are in\nthe course of employer-employee relation (i.e., a \u201ccontract of service\u201d) or is there any element of\n\u201ccontract for service\u201d. The issue has been deliberated by various courts and it has been held that a\ndirector who has also taken an employment in the company may be functioning in dual capacities,\nnamely, one as a director of the company and the other on the basis of the contractual relationship of\nmaster and servant with the company, i.e. under a contract of service (employment) entered into with\nthe company.\n5.2 It is also pertinent to note that similar identification (to that in Para 5.1 above) and treatment of the\nDirector\u2019s remuneration is also present in the Income Tax Act, 1961 wherein the salaries paid to\ndirectors are subject to Tax Deducted at Source ('TDS') under Section 192 of the Income Tax Act,\n1961 ('IT Act'). However, in cases where the remuneration is in the nature of professional fees and not\nsalary, the same is liable for deduction under Section 194J of the IT Act. 5.3. Accordingly, it is clarified that the part of Director\u2019s remuneration which are declared as\n\u201cSalaries\u2019 in the books of a company and subjected to TDS under Section 192 of the IT Act, are not\ntaxable being consideration for services by an employee to the employer in the course of or in relation\nto his employment in terms of Schedule III of the CGST Act, 2017.\n5.4 It is further clarified that the part of employee Director\u2019s remuneration which is declared\nseparately other than \u201csalaries\u2019 in the Company\u2019s accounts and subjected to TDS under Section 194J\nof the IT Act as Fees for professional or Technical Services shall be treated as consideration for\nproviding services which are outside the scope of Schedule III of the CGST Act, and is therefore,\ntaxable. Further, in terms of Notification No. 13/2017-Central Tax (Rate), dated 28.06.2017, the\nrecipient of the said services i.e. the Company, is liable to discharge the applicable GST on it on\nreverse charge basis."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What is the GST implication on Director sitting fees?"}], "ideal": "### Leviability of GST on Director's Remuneration\nThe retrieved contexts provide a detailed clarification on the GST treatment of remuneration paid to directors of a company.
