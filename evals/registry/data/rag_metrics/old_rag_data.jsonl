{"input": [{"role": "system", "content": "As an expert legal consultant, provide a detailed response to the question below, considering the given context: Scope of Intermediary services:\n\n2.1 \u2018Intermediary\u2019 has been defined in the sub-section (13) of section 2 of the\nIntegrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 (hereinafter referred to as \u201cIGST\u201d\nAct) as under\u2013\n\u201cIntermediary means a broker, an agent or any other person, by whatever\nname called, who arranges or facilitates the supply of goods or services or both,\nor securities, between two or more persons, but does not include a person who\nsupplies such goods or services or both or securities on his own account.\u201d\n\n2.2 The concept of \u2018intermediary\u2019 was borrowed in GST from the Service\nTax Regime. The definition of \u2018intermediary\u2019 in the Service Tax law as given in\nRule 2(f) of Place of Provision of Services Rules, 2012 issued vide notification\nNo. 28/2012-ST, dated 20-6-2012 was as follows:\n\u201cintermediary\u201d means a broker, an agent or any other person, by whatever\nname called, who arranges or facilitates a provision of a service (hereinafter\ncalled the \u2018main\u2019 service) or a supply of goods, between two or more persons, but\ndoes not include a person who provides the main service or supplies the goods on\nhis account;\u201d\n\n2.3 From the perusal of the definition of \u201cintermediary\u201d under IGST Act as\nwell as under Service Tax law, it is evident that there is broadly no change in the\nscope of intermediary services in the GST regime vis-\u00e0-vis the Service Tax\nregime, except addition of supply of securities in the definition of intermediary in\nthe GST Law.\n\n3. Primary Requirements for intermediary services:\nThe concept of intermediary services, as defined above, requires some basic\nprerequisites, which are discussed below:\n\n3.1 Minimum of Three Parties: By definition, an intermediary is someone\nwho arranges or facilitates the supplies of goods or services or securities between\ntwo or more persons. It is thus a natural corollary that the arrangement requires a\nminimum of three parties, two of them transacting in the supply of goods or\nservices or securities (the main supply) and one arranging or facilitating (the\nancillary supply) the said main supply. An activity between only two parties can,\ntherefore, NOT be considered as an intermediary service. An intermediary\nessentially \u201carranges or facilitates\u201d another supply (the \u201cmain supply\u201d) between\ntwo or more other persons and, does not himself provide the main supply.\n\n3.2 Two distinct supplies: As discussed above, there are two distinct supplies\nin case of provision of intermediary services;\n\n(1) Main supply, between the two principals, which can be a supply of goods\nor services or securities;\n\n(2) Ancillary supply, which is the service of facilitating or arranging the main\nsupply between the two principals. This ancillary supply is supply of\nintermediary service and is clearly identifiable and distinguished from the main\nsupply.\n\nA person involved in supply of main supply on principal to principal basis to\nanother person cannot be considered as supplier of intermediary service.\n\n3.3 Intermediary service provider to have the character of an agent,\nbroker or any other similar person: The definition of \u201cintermediary\u201d itself\nprovides that intermediary service provider means a broker, an agent or any other person, by whatever name called....\u201d. This part of the definition is not inclusive but uses the expression \u201cmeans\u201d and does not expand the definition by any known expression of expansion such as \u201cand includes\u201d. The use of the expression\"arranges or facilitates\u201d in the definition of \u201cintermediary\u201d suggests a subsidiary\nrole for the intermediary. It must arrange or facilitate some other supply, which is\nthe main supply, and does not himself provides the main supply. Thus, the role of ntermediary is only supportive.\n\n3.4 Does not include a person who supplies such goods or services or\nboth or securities on his own account: The definition of intermediary services\nspecifically mentions that intermediary \u201cdoes not include a person who supplies\nsuch goods or services or both or securities on his own account\u201d. Use of word\n\u201csuch\u201d in the definition with reference to supply of goods or services refers to the\nmain supply of goods or services or both, or securities, between two or more\npersons, which are arranged or facilitated by the intermediary. It implies that in\ncases wherein the person supplies the main supply, either fully or partly, on\nprincipal to principal basis, the said supply cannot be covered under the scope of\n\u201cintermediary\u201d.\n\n3.5 Sub-contracting for a service is not an intermediary service: An\nimportant exclusion from intermediary is sub-contracting. The supplier of main\nservice may decide to outsource the supply of the main service, either fully or\npartly, to one or more sub-contractors. Such sub-contractor provides the main\nsupply, either fully or a part thereof, and does not merely arrange or facilitate the\nmain supply between the principal supplier and his customers, and therefore,\nclearly is not an intermediary. For instance, \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 have entered into a\ncontract as per which \u2018A\u2019 needs to provide a service of, say, Annual Maintenance\nof tools and machinery to \u2018B\u2019. \u2018A\u2019 subcontracts a part or whole of it to \u2018C\u2019.\nAccordingly, \u2018C\u2019 provides the service of annual maintenance to \u2018A\u2019 as part of\nsuch sub-contract, by providing annual maintenance of tools and machinery to\nthe customer of \u2018A\u2019, i.e. to \u2018B\u2019 on behalf of \u2018A\u2019. Though \u2018C\u2019 is dealing with the\ncustomer of \u2018A\u2019, but \u2018C\u2019 is providing main supply of Annual Maintenance\nService to \u2018A\u2019 on his own account, i.e. on principal to principal basis. In this\ncase, \u2018A\u2019 is providing supply of Annual Maintenance Service to \u2018B\u2019, whereas \u2018C\u2019\nis supplying the same service to \u2018A\u2019. Thus, supply of service by \u2018C\u2019 in this case\nwill not be considered as an intermediary.\n\n3.6 The specific provision of place of supply of \u2018intermediary services\u2019 under\nsection 13 of the IGST Act shall be invoked only when either the location of\nsupplier of intermediary services or location of the recipient of intermediary\nservices is outside India.\n\n4. Applying the abovementioned guiding principles, the issue of intermediary\nservices is clarified through the following illustrations:\n\nIllustration 1 \u2018A\u2019 is a manufacturer and supplier of a machine. \u2018C\u2019 helps \u2018A\u2019\nin selling the machine by identifying client \u2018B\u2019 who wants to purchase this\nmachine and helps in finalizing the contract of supply of machine by \u2018A\u2019 to \u2018B\u2019.\n\u2018C\u2019 charges \u2018A\u2019 for his services of locating \u2018B\u2019 and helping in finalizing the sale\nof machine between \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019, for which \u2018C\u2019 invoices \u2018A\u2019 and is paid by \u2018A\u2019\nfor the same. While \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 are involved in the main supply of the\nmachinery, \u2018C\u2019, is facilitating the supply of machine between \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019. In this\narrangement, \u2018C\u2019 is providing the ancillary supply of arranging or facilitating the\n\u2018main supply\u2019 of machinery between \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 and therefore, \u2018C\u2019 is an\nintermediary and is providing intermediary service to \u2018A\u2019.\n\nIllustration 2 \u2018A\u2019 is a software company which develops software for the\nclients as per their requirement. \u2018A\u2019 has a contract with \u2018B\u2019 for providing some\ncustomized software for its business operations.\n\u2018A\u2019 outsources the task of design and development of a particular module of\nthe software to \u2018C\u2019, for which \u201cC\u2019 may have to interact with \u2018B\u2019, to know their\nspecific requirements. In this case, \u2018C\u2019 is providing main supply of service of\ndesign and development of software to \u2018A\u2019, and thus, \u2018C\u2019 is not an intermediary\nin this case.\n\nIllustration 3 An insurance company \u2018P\u2019, located outside India, requires to\nprocess insurance claims of its clients in respect of the insurance service being\nprovided by \u2018P\u2019 to the clients. For processing insurance claims, \u2018P\u2019 decides to\noutsource this work to some other firm. For this purpose, he approaches \u2018Q\u2019,\nlocated in India, for arranging insurance claims processing service from other\nservice providers in India. \u2018Q\u2019 contacts \u2018R\u2019, who is in business of providing such\ninsurance claims processing service, and arranges supply of insurance claims\nprocessing service by \u2018R\u2019 to \u2018P\u2019. \u2018Q\u2019 charges P a commission or service charge of\n1% of the contract value of insurance claims processing service provided by \u2018R\u2019\nto \u2018P\u2019. In such a case, main supply of insurance claims processing service is\nbetween \u2018P\u2019 and \u2018R\u2019, while \u2018Q\u2019 is merely arranging or facilitating the supply of\nservices between \u2018P\u2019 and \u2018R\u2019, and not himself providing the main supply of\nservices. Accordingly, in this case, \u2018Q\u2019 acts as an intermediary as per definition\nof sub-section (13) of section 2 of the IGST Act.\n\nIllustration 4 \u2018A\u2019 is a manufacturer and supplier of computers based in USA\nand supplies its goods all over the world. As a part of this supply, \u2018A\u2019 is also\nrequired to provide customer care service to its customers to address their queries\nand complains related to the said supply of computers. \u2018A\u2019 decides to outsource\nthe task of providing customer care services to a BPO firm, \u2018B\u2019. \u2018B\u2019 provides\ncustomer care service to \u2018A\u2019 by interacting with the customers of \u2018A\u2019 and\naddressing/processing their queries/complains. \u2019B\u2019 charges \u2018A\u2019 for this service.\n\u2018B\u2019 is involved in supply of main service \u2018customer care service\u2019 to \u2018A\u2019, and\ntherefore, \u2018B\u2019 is not an intermediary.\n\n5. The illustrations given in para 4 above are only indicative and not\nexhaustive. The illustrations are also generic in nature and should not be\ninterpreted to mean that the service categories mentioned therein are inherently\neither intermediary services or otherwise. Whether or not, a specific service\nwould fall under intermediary services within the meaning of sub-section (13) of\nsection 2 of the IGST Act, would depend upon the facts of the specific case.\nWhile examining the facts of the case and the terms of contract, the basic\ncharacteristics of intermediary services, as discussed in para 3 above should be\nkept in consideration.\n\nAdvance Rulings\n\nIn Re: Fulcrum Global Info Services LLP 2019 (30) G.S.T.L. 261 (A.A.R. \u2013\nGST-Karnataka), held that \u201cSupport services - Back-end support services\nprovided to client under agreement - Scope of work include trade compliance\noperations management involving compliance screening relevant to client\u2019s\nbusiness, as instructed and trained by client, helpdesk support services including\nproviding status of shipment to client\u2019s internal and external customers and\ncertain administrative tasks - Details of works entrusted to assessee by client\nshowing that client outsourced its works to assessee and assessee providing his\nservices either updating in system and if system not able to process work,\nupdating it manually - No interaction between assessee and the third persons,\neither directly or indirectly and assessee concerned only with work entrusted to it\non system - Assessee not involved as an intermediary - Assessee\u2019s activities was\nsupport service provided to recipient of services - Services classifiable under\nSAC 9985 more specifically under Service Accounting Code 998599 as \u201cOther\nsupport services nowhere else classified in terms of Notification No. 11/2017-\nC.T.

Scope of Intermediary services\n2.1 \u2018Intermediary\u2019 has been defined in the sub-section (13) of section 2 of the Integrated Goods and\nServices Tax Act, 2017 (hereinafter referred to as \u201cIGST\u201d Act) as under\u2014\n\u201cIntermediary means a broker, an agent or any other person, by whatever name called, who\narranges or facilitates the supply of goods or services or both, or securities, between two or more\npersons, but does not include a person who supplies such goods or services or both or securities\non his own account.\u201d\n2.2 The concept of \u2018intermediary\u2019 was borrowed in GST from the Service Tax Regime. The definition\nof \u2018intermediary\u2019 in the Service Tax law as given in Rule 2(f) of Place of Provision of Services Rules,\n2012 issued vide Notification No. 28/2012-ST, dated 20-6-2012 was as follows: \u2014\n\n\u201cintermediary\u201d means a broker, an agent or any other person, by whatever name called, who\narranges or facilitates a provision of a service (hereinafter called the \u2018main\u2019 service) or a supply\nof goods, between two or more persons, but does not include a person who provides the main\nservice or supplies the goods on his account;\u201d\n2.3 From the perusal of the definition of \u201cintermediary\u201d under IGST Act as well as under Service Tax\nlaw, it is evident that there is broadly no change in the scope of intermediary services in the GST\nregime vis-\u00e0-vis the Service Tax regime, except addition of supply of securities in the definition of\nintermediary in the GST Law.\n3. Primary Requirements for intermediary services\nThe concept of intermediary services, as defined above, requires some basic pre-requisites, which are\ndiscussed below:\n3.1 Minimum of Three Parties: By definition, an intermediary is someone who arranges or facilitates\nthe supplies of goods or services or securities between two or more persons. It is thus a natural\ncorollary that the arrangement requires a minimum of three parties, two of them transacting in the\nsupply of goods or services or securities (the main supply) and one arranging or facilitating (the\nancillary supply) the said main supply. An activity between only two parties can, therefore, not be\nconsidered as an intermediary service. An intermediary essentially \u201carranges or facilitates\u201d another\nsupply (the \u201cmain supply\u201d) between two or more other persons and, does not himself provide the main\nsupply.\n3.2 Two distinct supplies: Following are two distinct supplies in case of provision of intermediary\nservices:\n(1) Main supply, between the two principals, which can be a supply of goods or services or\nsecurities.\n(2) Ancillary supply, which is the service of facilitating or arranging the main supply between the\ntwo principals. This ancillary supply is supply of intermediary service and is clearly identifiable\nand distinguished from the main supply.\nA person involved in supply of main supply on principal-to-principal basis to another person cannot be\nconsidered as supplier of intermediary service.\n3.3 Intermediary service provider to have the character of an agent, broker or any other similar\nperson: The definition of \u201cintermediary\u201d itself provides that intermediary service provider means a\nbroker, an agent or any other person, by whatever name called....\u201d This part of the definition is not\ninclusive but uses the expression \u201cmeans\u201d and does not expand the definition by any known expression\nof expansion such as \u201cand includes\u201d. The use of the expression \u201carranges or facilitates\u201d in the\ndefinition of \u201cintermediary\u201d suggests a subsidiary role for the intermediary. It must arrange or facilitate\nsome other supply, which is the main supply, and does not himself provides the main supply. Thus, the\nrole of intermediary is only supportive.\n3.4 Does not include a person who supplies such goods or services or both or securities on his\nown account: The definition of intermediary services specifically mentions that intermediary \u201cdoes\nnot include a person who supplies such goods or services or both or securities on his own account\u201d.\nUse of word \u201csuch\u201d in the definition with reference to supply of goods or services refers to the main\nsupply of goods or services or both, or securities, between two or more persons, which are arranged or\nfacilitated by the intermediary. It implies that in cases wherein the person supplies the main supply,\neither fully or partly, on principal-to-principal basis, the said supply cannot be covered under the scope\nof \u201cintermediary\u201d.\n3.5 Sub-contracting for a service is not an intermediary service: An important exclusion from\nintermediary is sub-contracting. The supplier of main service may decide to outsource the supply of the\nmain service, either fully or partly, to one or more sub-contractors. Such sub-contractor provides the\nmain supply, either fully or a part thereof, and does not merely arrange or facilitate the main supply\nbetween the principal supplier and his customers, and therefore, clearly is not an intermediary. For\ninstance, \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 have entered into a contract as per which \u2018A\u2019 needs to provide a service of, say,\n\nAnnual Maintenance of tools and machinery to \u2018B\u2019. \u2018A\u2019 subcontracts a part or whole of it to \u2018C\u2019.\nAccordingly, \u2018C\u2019 provides the service of annual maintenance to \u2018A\u2019 as part of such sub-contract, by\nproviding annual maintenance of tools and machinery to the customer of \u2018A\u2019, i.e., to \u2018B\u2019 on behalf of\n\u2018A\u2019. Though \u2018C\u2019 is dealing with the customer of \u2018A\u2019, but \u2018C\u2019 is providing main supply of Annual\nMaintenance Service to \u2018A\u2019 on his own account, i.e., on principal-to-principal basis. In this case, \u2018A\u2019 is\nproviding supply of Annual Maintenance Service to \u2018B\u2019, whereas \u2018C\u2019 is supplying the same service to\n\u2018A\u2019. Thus, supply of service by \u2018C\u2019 in this case will not be considered as an intermediary.\n3.6 The specific provision of place of supply of \u2018intermediary services\u2019 under section 13 of the IGST\nAct shall be invoked only when either the location of supplier of intermediary services or location of\nthe recipient of intermediary services is outside India.\n4. Applying the abovementioned guiding principles, the issue of intermediary services is clarified\nthrough the following illustrations:\nIllustration 1\n\u2018A\u2019 is a manufacturer and supplier of a machine. \u2018C\u2019 helps \u2018A\u2019 in selling the machine by identifying\nclient \u2018B\u2019 who wants to purchase this machine and helps in finalizing the contract of supply of machine\nby \u2018A\u2019 to \u2018B\u2019. \u2018C\u2019 charges \u2018A\u2019 for his services of locating \u2018B\u2019 and helping in finalizing the sale of\nmachine between \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019, for which \u2018C\u2019 invoices \u2018A\u2019 and is paid by \u2018A\u2019 for the same. While \u2018A\u2019\nand \u2018B\u2019 are involved in the main supply of the machinery, \u2018C\u2019, is facilitating the supply of machine\nbetween \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019. In this arrangement, \u2018C\u2019 is providing the ancillary supply of arranging or\nfacilitating the \u2018main supply\u2019 of machinery between \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 and therefore, \u2018C\u2019 is an intermediary\nand is providing intermediary service to \u2018A\u2019.\nIllustration 2\n\u2018A\u2019 is a software company which develops software for the clients as per their requirement.\n\u2018A\u2019 has a contract with \u2018B\u2019 for providing some customized software for its business operations.\n\u2018A\u2019 outsources the task of design and development of a particular module of the software to \u2018C\u2019, for\nwhich \u201cC\u2019 may have to interact with \u2018B\u2019, to know their specific requirements. In this case, \u2018C\u2019 is\nproviding main supply of service of design and development of software to \u2018A\u2019, and thus, \u2018C\u2019 is not an\nintermediary in this case.\nIllustration 3\nAn insurance company \u2018P\u2019, located outside India, requires to process insurance claims of its clients in\nrespect of the insurance service being provided by \u2018P\u2019 to the clients. For processing insurance claims,\n\u2018P\u2019 decides to outsource this work to some other firm. For this purpose, he approaches \u2018Q\u2019, located in\nIndia, for arranging insurance claims processing service from other service providers in India. \u2018Q\u2019\ncontacts \u2018R\u2019, who is in business of providing such insurance claims processing service and arranges\nsupply of insurance claims processing service by \u2018R\u2019 to \u2018P\u2019. \u2018Q\u2019 charges P a commission or service\ncharge of 1% of the contract value of insurance claims processing service provided by \u2018R\u2019 to \u2018P\u2019. In\nsuch a case, main supply of insurance claims processing service is between \u2018P\u2019 and \u2018R\u2019, while \u2018Q\u2019 is\nmerely arranging or facilitating the supply of services between \u2018P\u2019 and \u2018R\u2019, and not himself providing\nthe main supply of services. Accordingly, in this case, \u2018Q\u2019 acts as an intermediary as per definition of\nsub-section (13) of section 2 of the IGST Act.\nIllustration 4\n\u2018A\u2019 is a manufacturer and supplier of computers based in USA and supplies its goods all over the\nworld. As a part of this supply, \u2018A\u2019 is also required to provide customer care service to its customers to\naddress their queries and complains related to the said supply of computers. \u2018A\u2019 decides to outsource\nthe task of providing customer care services to a BPO firm, \u2018B\u2019. \u2018B\u2019 provides customer care service to\n\u2018A\u2019 by interacting with the customers of \u2018A\u2019 and addressing/processing their queries/complains. \u2019B\u2019\ncharges \u2018A\u2019 for this service. \u2018B\u2019 is involved in supply of main service \u2018customer care service\u2019 to \u2018A\u2019,\nand therefore,\u2019 \u2018B\u2019 is not an intermediary.\n5. The illustrations given in para 4 above are only indicative and not exhaustive. The illustrations are\nalso generic in nature and should not be interpreted to mean that the service categories mentioned therein are inherently either intermediary services or otherwise. Whether or not, a specific service\nwould fall under intermediary services within the meaning of sub-section (13) of section 2 of the IGST\nAct, would depend upon the facts of the specific case. While examining the facts of the case and the\nterms of contract, the basic characteristics of intermediary services, as discussed in para 3 above,\nshould be kept in consideration."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Explain the concept of intermediary services under gst with examples"}], "ideal": "Under GST, \"intermediary services\" are defined and regulated under Section 2(13) of the Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST) Act, 2017.
