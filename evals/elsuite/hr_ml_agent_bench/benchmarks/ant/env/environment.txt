This environment contains a 3D robot consisting of one torso (free rotational body) with four legs attached to it with each leg having two body parts. The goal is to coordinate the four legs to move in the forward (right) direction by applying torques on the eight hinges connecting the two body parts of each leg and the torso (nine body parts and eight hinges).
