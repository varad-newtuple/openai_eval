       "    'content': 'As an expert legal consultant, provide a detailed response to the question below, considering the given context: Scope of Intermediary services:\\n\\n2.1 ‘Intermediary’ has been defined in the sub-section (13) of section 2 of the\\nIntegrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 (hereinafter referred to as “IGST”\\nAct) as under–\\n“Intermediary means a broker, an agent or any other person, by whatever\\nname called, who arranges or facilitates the supply of goods or services or both,\\nor securities, between two or more persons, but does not include a person who\\nsupplies such goods or services or both or securities on his own account.”\\n\\n2.2 The concept of ‘intermediary’ was borrowed in GST from the Service\\nTax Regime. The definition of ‘intermediary’ in the Service Tax law as given in\\nRule 2(f) of Place of Provision of Services Rules, 2012 issued vide notification\\nNo. 28/2012-ST, dated 20-6-2012 was as follows:\\n“intermediary” means a broker, an agent or any other person, by whatever\\nname called, who arranges or facilitates a provision of a service (hereinafter\\ncalled the ‘main’ service) or a supply of goods, between two or more persons, but\\ndoes not include a person who provides the main service or supplies the goods on\\nhis account;”\\n\\n2.3 From the perusal of the definition of “intermediary” under IGST Act as\\nwell as under Service Tax law, it is evident that there is broadly no change in the\\nscope of intermediary services in the GST regime vis-à-vis the Service Tax\\nregime, except addition of supply of securities in the definition of intermediary in\\nthe GST Law.\\n\\n3. Primary Requirements for intermediary services:\\nThe concept of intermediary services, as defined above, requires some basic\\nprerequisites, which are discussed below:\\n\\n3.1 Minimum of Three Parties: By definition, an intermediary is someone\\nwho arranges or facilitates the supplies of goods or services or securities between\\ntwo or more persons. It is thus a natural corollary that the arrangement requires a\\nminimum of three parties, two of them transacting in the supply of goods or\\nservices or securities (the main supply) and one arranging or facilitating (the\\nancillary supply) the said main supply. An activity between only two parties can,\\ntherefore, NOT be considered as an intermediary service. An intermediary\\nessentially “arranges or facilitates” another supply (the “main supply”) between\\ntwo or more other persons and, does not himself provide the main supply.\\n\\n3.2 Two distinct supplies: As discussed above, there are two distinct supplies\\nin case of provision of intermediary services;\\n\\n(1) Main supply, between the two principals, which can be a supply of goods\\nor services or securities;\\n\\n(2) Ancillary supply, which is the service of facilitating or arranging the main\\nsupply between the two principals. This ancillary supply is supply of\\nintermediary service and is clearly identifiable and distinguished from the main\\nsupply.\\n\\nA person involved in supply of main supply on principal to principal basis to\\nanother person cannot be considered as supplier of intermediary service.\\n\\n3.3 Intermediary service provider to have the character of an agent,\\nbroker or any other similar person: The definition of “intermediary” itself\\nprovides that intermediary service provider means a broker, an agent or any other person, by whatever name called....”. This part of the definition is not inclusive but uses the expression “means” and does not expand the definition by any known expression of expansion such as “and includes”. The use of the expression\"arranges or facilitates” in the definition of “intermediary” suggests a subsidiary\\nrole for the intermediary. It must arrange or facilitate some other supply, which is\\nthe main supply, and does not himself provides the main supply. Thus, the role of ntermediary is only supportive.\\n\\n3.4 Does not include a person who supplies such goods or services or\\nboth or securities on his own account: The definition of intermediary services\\nspecifically mentions that intermediary “does not include a person who supplies\\nsuch goods or services or both or securities on his own account”. Use of word\\n“such” in the definition with reference to supply of goods or services refers to the\\nmain supply of goods or services or both, or securities, between two or more\\npersons, which are arranged or facilitated by the intermediary. It implies that in\\ncases wherein the person supplies the main supply, either fully or partly, on\\nprincipal to principal basis, the said supply cannot be covered under the scope of\\n“intermediary”.\\n\\n3.5 Sub-contracting for a service is not an intermediary service: An\\nimportant exclusion from intermediary is sub-contracting. The supplier of main\\nservice may decide to outsource the supply of the main service, either fully or\\npartly, to one or more sub-contractors. Such sub-contractor provides the main\\nsupply, either fully or a part thereof, and does not merely arrange or facilitate the\\nmain supply between the principal supplier and his customers, and therefore,\\nclearly is not an intermediary. For instance, ‘A’ and ‘B’ have entered into a\\ncontract as per which ‘A’ needs to provide a service of, say, Annual Maintenance\\nof tools and machinery to ‘B’. ‘A’ subcontracts a part or whole of it to ‘C’.\\nAccordingly, ‘C’ provides the service of annual maintenance to ‘A’ as part of\\nsuch sub-contract, by providing annual maintenance of tools and machinery to\\nthe customer of ‘A’, i.e. to ‘B’ on behalf of ‘A’. Though ‘C’ is dealing with the\\ncustomer of ‘A’, but ‘C’ is providing main supply of Annual Maintenance\\nService to ‘A’ on his own account, i.e. on principal to principal basis. In this\\ncase, ‘A’ is providing supply of Annual Maintenance Service to ‘B’, whereas ‘C’\\nis supplying the same service to ‘A’. Thus, supply of service by ‘C’ in this case\\nwill not be considered as an intermediary.\\n\\n3.6 The specific provision of place of supply of ‘intermediary services’ under\\nsection 13 of the IGST Act shall be invoked only when either the location of\\nsupplier of intermediary services or location of the recipient of intermediary\\nservices is outside India.\\n\\n4. Applying the abovementioned guiding principles, the issue of intermediary\\nservices is clarified through the following illustrations:\\n\\nIllustration 1 ‘A’ is a manufacturer and supplier of a machine. ‘C’ helps ‘A’\\nin selling the machine by identifying client ‘B’ who wants to purchase this\\nmachine and helps in finalizing the contract of supply of machine by ‘A’ to ‘B’.\\n‘C’ charges ‘A’ for his services of locating ‘B’ and helping in finalizing the sale\\nof machine between ‘A’ and ‘B’, for which ‘C’ invoices ‘A’ and is paid by ‘A’\\nfor the same. While ‘A’ and ‘B’ are involved in the main supply of the\\nmachinery, ‘C’, is facilitating the supply of machine between ‘A’ and ‘B’. In this\\narrangement, ‘C’ is providing the ancillary supply of arranging or facilitating the\\n‘main supply’ of machinery between ‘A’ and ‘B’ and therefore, ‘C’ is an\\nintermediary and is providing intermediary service to ‘A’.\\n\\nIllustration 2 ‘A’ is a software company which develops software for the\\nclients as per their requirement. ‘A’ has a contract with ‘B’ for providing some\\ncustomized software for its business operations.\\n‘A’ outsources the task of design and development of a particular module of\\nthe software to ‘C’, for which “C’ may have to interact with ‘B’, to know their\\nspecific requirements. In this case, ‘C’ is providing main supply of service of\\ndesign and development of software to ‘A’, and thus, ‘C’ is not an intermediary\\nin this case.\\n\\nIllustration 3 An insurance company ‘P’, located outside India, requires to\\nprocess insurance claims of its clients in respect of the insurance service being\\nprovided by ‘P’ to the clients. For processing insurance claims, ‘P’ decides to\\noutsource this work to some other firm. For this purpose, he approaches ‘Q’,\\nlocated in India, for arranging insurance claims processing service from other\\nservice providers in India. ‘Q’ contacts ‘R’, who is in business of providing such\\ninsurance claims processing service, and arranges supply of insurance claims\\nprocessing service by ‘R’ to ‘P’. ‘Q’ charges P a commission or service charge of\\n1% of the contract value of insurance claims processing service provided by ‘R’\\nto ‘P’. In such a case, main supply of insurance claims processing service is\\nbetween ‘P’ and ‘R’, while ‘Q’ is merely arranging or facilitating the supply of\\nservices between ‘P’ and ‘R’, and not himself providing the main supply of\\nservices. Accordingly, in this case, ‘Q’ acts as an intermediary as per definition\\nof sub-section (13) of section 2 of the IGST Act.\\n\\nIllustration 4 ‘A’ is a manufacturer and supplier of computers based in USA\\nand supplies its goods all over the world. As a part of this supply, ‘A’ is also\\nrequired to provide customer care service to its customers to address their queries\\nand complains related to the said supply of computers. ‘A’ decides to outsource\\nthe task of providing customer care services to a BPO firm, ‘B’. ‘B’ provides\\ncustomer care service to ‘A’ by interacting with the customers of ‘A’ and\\naddressing/processing their queries/complains. ’B’ charges ‘A’ for this service.\\n‘B’ is involved in supply of main service ‘customer care service’ to ‘A’, and\\ntherefore, ‘B’ is not an intermediary.\\n\\n5. The illustrations given in para 4 above are only indicative and not\\nexhaustive. The illustrations are also generic in nature and should not be\\ninterpreted to mean that the service categories mentioned therein are inherently\\neither intermediary services or otherwise. Whether or not, a specific service\\nwould fall under intermediary services within the meaning of sub-section (13) of\\nsection 2 of the IGST Act, would depend upon the facts of the specific case.\\nWhile examining the facts of the case and the terms of contract, the basic\\ncharacteristics of intermediary services, as discussed in para 3 above should be\\nkept in consideration.\\n\\nAdvance Rulings\\n\\nIn Re: Fulcrum Global Info Services LLP 2019 (30) G.S.T.L. 261 (A.A.R. –\\nGST-Karnataka), held that “Support services - Back-end support services\\nprovided to client under agreement - Scope of work include trade compliance\\noperations management involving compliance screening relevant to client’s\\nbusiness, as instructed and trained by client, helpdesk support services including\\nproviding status of shipment to client’s internal and external customers and\\ncertain administrative tasks - Details of works entrusted to assessee by client\\nshowing that client outsourced its works to assessee and assessee providing his\\nservices either updating in system and if system not able to process work,\\nupdating it manually - No interaction between assessee and the third persons,\\neither directly or indirectly and assessee concerned only with work entrusted to it\\non system - Assessee not involved as an intermediary - Assessee’s activities was\\nsupport service provided to recipient of services - Services classifiable under\\nSAC 9985 more specifically under Service Accounting Code 998599 as “Other\\nsupport services nowhere else classified in terms of Notification No. 11/2017-\\nC.T.

The matter has been examined. In view of the difficulties\\nbeing faced by the trade and industry and to ensure uniformity in the implementation of the provisions\\nof the law across field formations, the Board, in exercise of its powers conferred by section 168(1) of\\nthe Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 (hereinafter referred to as “CGST Act”), hereby\\nclarifies the issues in succeeding paragraphs.\\n2. Scope of Intermediary services\\n2.1 ‘Intermediary’ has been defined in the sub-section (13) of section 2 of the Integrated Goods and\\nServices Tax Act, 2017 (hereinafter referred to as “IGST” Act) as under—\\n“Intermediary means a broker, an agent or any other person, by whatever name called, who\\narranges or facilitates the supply of goods or services or both, or securities, between two or more\\npersons, but does not include a person who supplies such goods or services or both or securities\\non his own account.”\\n2.2 The concept of ‘intermediary’ was borrowed in GST from the Service Tax Regime. The definition\\nof ‘intermediary’ in the Service Tax law as given in Rule 2(f) of Place of Provision of Services Rules,\\n2012 issued vide Notification No. 28/2012-ST, dated 20-6-2012 was as follows: —\\n\\n“intermediary” means a broker, an agent or any other person, by whatever name called, who\\narranges or facilitates a provision of a service (hereinafter called the ‘main’ service) or a supply\\nof goods, between two or more persons, but does not include a person who provides the main\\nservice or supplies the goods on his account;”\\n2.3 From the perusal of the definition of “intermediary” under IGST Act as well as under Service Tax\\nlaw, it is evident that there is broadly no change in the scope of intermediary services in the GST\\nregime vis-à-vis the Service Tax regime, except addition of supply of securities in the definition of\\nintermediary in the GST Law.\\n3. Primary Requirements for intermediary services\\nThe concept of intermediary services, as defined above, requires some basic pre-requisites, which are\\ndiscussed below:\\n3.1 Minimum of Three Parties: By definition, an intermediary is someone who arranges or facilitates\\nthe supplies of goods or services or securities between two or more persons. It is thus a natural\\ncorollary that the arrangement requires a minimum of three parties, two of them transacting in the\\nsupply of goods or services or securities (the main supply) and one arranging or facilitating (the\\nancillary supply) the said main supply. An activity between only two parties can, therefore, not be\\nconsidered as an intermediary service. An intermediary essentially “arranges or facilitates” another\\nsupply (the “main supply”) between two or more other persons and, does not himself provide the main\\nsupply.\\n3.2 Two distinct supplies: Following are two distinct supplies in case of provision of intermediary\\nservices:\\n(1) Main supply, between the two principals, which can be a supply of goods or services or\\nsecurities.\\n(2) Ancillary supply, which is the service of facilitating or arranging the main supply between the\\ntwo principals. This ancillary supply is supply of intermediary service and is clearly identifiable\\nand distinguished from the main supply.\\nA person involved in supply of main supply on principal-to-principal basis to another person cannot be\\nconsidered as supplier of intermediary service.\\n3.3 Intermediary service provider to have the character of an agent, broker or any other similar\\nperson: The definition of “intermediary” itself provides that intermediary service provider means a\\nbroker, an agent or any other person, by whatever name called....” This part of the definition is not\\ninclusive but uses the expression “means” and does not expand the definition by any known expression\\nof expansion such as “and includes”. The use of the expression “arranges or facilitates” in the\\ndefinition of “intermediary” suggests a subsidiary role for the intermediary. It must arrange or facilitate\\nsome other supply, which is the main supply, and does not himself provides the main supply. Thus, the\\nrole of intermediary is only supportive.\\n3.4 Does not include a person who supplies such goods or services or both or securities on his\\nown account: The definition of intermediary services specifically mentions that intermediary “does\\nnot include a person who supplies such goods or services or both or securities on his own account”.\\nUse of word “such” in the definition with reference to supply of goods or services refers to the main\\nsupply of goods or services or both, or securities, between two or more persons, which are arranged or\\nfacilitated by the intermediary. It implies that in cases wherein the person supplies the main supply,\\neither fully or partly, on principal-to-principal basis, the said supply cannot be covered under the scope\\nof “intermediary”.\\n3.5 Sub-contracting for a service is not an intermediary service: An important exclusion from\\nintermediary is sub-contracting. The supplier of main service may decide to outsource the supply of the\\nmain service, either fully or partly, to one or more sub-contractors. Such sub-contractor provides the\\nmain supply, either fully or a part thereof, and does not merely arrange or facilitate the main supply\\nbetween the principal supplier and his customers, and therefore, clearly is not an intermediary. For\\ninstance, ‘A’ and ‘B’ have entered into a contract as per which ‘A’ needs to provide a service of, say,\\n\\nAnnual Maintenance of tools and machinery to ‘B’. ‘A’ subcontracts a part or whole of it to ‘C’.\\nAccordingly, ‘C’ provides the service of annual maintenance to ‘A’ as part of such sub-contract, by\\nproviding annual maintenance of tools and machinery to the customer of ‘A’, i.e., to ‘B’ on behalf of\\n‘A’. Though ‘C’ is dealing with the customer of ‘A’, but ‘C’ is providing main supply of Annual\\nMaintenance Service to ‘A’ on his own account, i.e., on principal-to-principal basis. In this case, ‘A’ is\\nproviding supply of Annual Maintenance Service to ‘B’, whereas ‘C’ is supplying the same service to\\n‘A’. Thus, supply of service by ‘C’ in this case will not be considered as an intermediary.\\n3.6 The specific provision of place of supply of ‘intermediary services’ under section 13 of the IGST\\nAct shall be invoked only when either the location of supplier of intermediary services or location of\\nthe recipient of intermediary services is outside India.\\n4. Applying the abovementioned guiding principles, the issue of intermediary services is clarified\\nthrough the following illustrations:\\nIllustration 1\\n‘A’ is a manufacturer and supplier of a machine. ‘C’ helps ‘A’ in selling the machine by identifying\\nclient ‘B’ who wants to purchase this machine and helps in finalizing the contract of supply of machine\\nby ‘A’ to ‘B’. ‘C’ charges ‘A’ for his services of locating ‘B’ and helping in finalizing the sale of\\nmachine between ‘A’ and ‘B’, for which ‘C’ invoices ‘A’ and is paid by ‘A’ for the same. While ‘A’\\nand ‘B’ are involved in the main supply of the machinery, ‘C’, is facilitating the supply of machine\\nbetween ‘A’ and ‘B’. In this arrangement, ‘C’ is providing the ancillary supply of arranging or\\nfacilitating the ‘main supply’ of machinery between ‘A’ and ‘B’ and therefore, ‘C’ is an intermediary\\nand is providing intermediary service to ‘A’.\\nIllustration 2\\n‘A’ is a software company which develops software for the clients as per their requirement.\\n‘A’ has a contract with ‘B’ for providing some customized software for its business operations.\\n‘A’ outsources the task of design and development of a particular module of the software to ‘C’, for\\nwhich “C’ may have to interact with ‘B’, to know their specific requirements. In this case, ‘C’ is\\nproviding main supply of service of design and development of software to ‘A’, and thus, ‘C’ is not an\\nintermediary in this case.\\nIllustration 3\\nAn insurance company ‘P’, located outside India, requires to process insurance claims of its clients in\\nrespect of the insurance service being provided by ‘P’ to the clients. For processing insurance claims,\\n‘P’ decides to outsource this work to some other firm. For this purpose, he approaches ‘Q’, located in\\nIndia, for arranging insurance claims processing service from other service providers in India. ‘Q’\\ncontacts ‘R’, who is in business of providing such insurance claims processing service and arranges\\nsupply of insurance claims processing service by ‘R’ to ‘P’. ‘Q’ charges P a commission or service\\ncharge of 1% of the contract value of insurance claims processing service provided by ‘R’ to ‘P’. In\\nsuch a case, main supply of insurance claims processing service is between ‘P’ and ‘R’, while ‘Q’ is\\nmerely arranging or facilitating the supply of services between ‘P’ and ‘R’, and not himself providing\\nthe main supply of services. Accordingly, in this case, ‘Q’ acts as an intermediary as per definition of\\nsub-section (13) of section 2 of the IGST Act.\\nIllustration 4\\n‘A’ is a manufacturer and supplier of computers based in USA and supplies its goods all over the\\nworld. As a part of this supply, ‘A’ is also required to provide customer care service to its customers to\\naddress their queries and complains related to the said supply of computers. ‘A’ decides to outsource\\nthe task of providing customer care services to a BPO firm, ‘B’. ‘B’ provides customer care service to\\n‘A’ by interacting with the customers of ‘A’ and addressing/processing their queries/complains. ’B’\\ncharges ‘A’ for this service. ‘B’ is involved in supply of main service ‘customer care service’ to ‘A’,\\nand therefore,’ ‘B’ is not an intermediary.\\n5. The illustrations given in para 4 above are only indicative and not exhaustive. The illustrations are\\nalso generic in nature and should not be interpreted to mean that the service categories mentioned therein are inherently either intermediary services or otherwise. Whether or not, a specific service\\nwould fall under intermediary services within the meaning of sub-section (13) of section 2 of the IGST\\nAct, would depend upon the facts of the specific case. While examining the facts of the case and the\\nterms of contract, the basic characteristics of intermediary services, as discussed in para 3 above,\\nshould be kept in consideration.'},\n",

       "  'ideal': 'Under GST, \"intermediary services\" are defined and regulated under Section 2(13) of the Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST) Act, 2017. An intermediary is a broker, agent, or any other person who arranges or facilitates the supply of goods, services, or securities between two or more persons but does not supply such goods, services, or securities on his own account. This definition emphasizes the role of an intermediary as a facilitator or arranger rather than a principal supplier.\\n\\n### Key Features of Intermediary Services: As per Circular No. 159/15/2021-GST, dated 22.09.2021\\n\\n1. **Minimum of Three Parties**: An intermediary service involves at least three parties:\\n - Two principals who are transacting in the supply of goods, services, or securities (the main supply).\\n - One intermediary who arranges or facilitates this main supply.\\n\\n2. **Two Distinct Supplies**:\\n - **Main Supply**: The core transaction of goods, services, or securities between the two principals.\\n - **Ancillary Supply**: The intermediary\\'s service of facilitating or arranging the main supply.\\n\\n3. **Nature of Service**:\\n - An intermediary does not alter the nature or value of the goods, services, or securities supplied.\\n - The intermediary\\'s service is distinctly separable from the main supply and often involves a commission.\\n\\n### Examples of Intermediary Services:\\n\\n1. **Freight Forwarder**:\\n - **As an Intermediary**: A freight forwarder arranging for international shipment acts as an intermediary\\n if they are not providing the transportation services themselves but facilitating the transaction between the\\n importer/exporter and the shipping company.\\n - **Not an Intermediary**: If the freight forwarder provides integrated transportation services and bills the customer directly for a combined service, they act on their own account and are not classified as an intermediary.\\n\\n2. **Commission Agent**:\\n - An agent who helps sell goods by finding buyers and facilitating the sale transaction between a supplier and buyer qualifies as an intermediary.\\n - **Illustration**: A person \\'C\\' helping a manufacturer \\'A\\' sell a machine to buyer \\'B\\' and charging \\'A\\' for this service is an intermediary.\\n\\n3. **Outsourcing Services**:\\n - **Not an Intermediary**: If a software company \\'A\\' outsources part of its development work to another company \\'C,\\' where \\'C\\' provides direct service (e.g., module development) to \\'A,\\' \\'C\\' is not an intermediary.\\n - **Intermediary**: If a firm \\'Q\\' in India arranges for \\'R\\' to process insurance claims for an insurance company \\'P\\' outside India and charges a commission for this facilitation, \\'Q\\' acts as an intermediary.\\n\\n### Place of Supply for Intermediary Services:\\n\\nThe determination of the place of supply is crucial for tax liability. As per Section 13(8) of the IGST Act, the place of supply for intermediary services is considered to be the location of the intermediary. This is noteworthy for determining GST applicability, especially in cross-border transactions.\\n\\n### Export of Services and Intermediary Services:\\n\\nIntermediary services do not qualify as \"export of services\" even if the intermediary facilitates transactions for entities outside India because the place of supply is considered the location of the intermediary (Section 13(8) of the IGST Act).\\n\\n### Judicial Pronouncements and Clarifications:\\n\\nIn Re: Fulcrum Global Info Services LLP 2019 (30) G.S.T.L. 261 (A.A.R. – GST-Karnataka), held that “Support services - Back-end support services\\nprovided to client under agreement - Scope of work include trade compliance operations management involving compliance screening relevant to client’s\\nbusiness, as instructed and trained by client, helpdesk support services including providing status of shipment to client’s internal and external customers and certain administrative tasks - Details of works entrusted to assessee by client showing that client outsourced its works to assessee and assessee providing his services either updating in system and if system not able to process work, updating it manually - No interaction between assessee and the third persons, either directly or indirectly and assessee concerned only with work entrusted to it on system - Assessee not involved as an intermediary - Assessee’s activities was support service provided to recipient of services - Services classifiable under SAC 9985 more specifically under Service Accounting Code 998599 as “Other support services nowhere else classified in terms of Notification No. 11/2017-C.T.

The issue has been examined. The transfer of tenancy rights against tenancy premium which is \\\\nalso known as “pagadi system” is prevalent in some States. In this system the tenant acquires, tenancy \\\\nrights in the property against payment of tenancy premium ( pagadi). The landlord may be owner of the \\\\nproperty but the possession of the same lies with the tenant. The tenant pays periodic rent to the \\\\nlandlord as long as he occupies the property. The tenant also usually has the option to sell the tenancy \\\\nright of t he said property and in such a case has to share a percentage of the proceed with owner of \\\\nland, as laid down in their tenancy agreement. Alternatively, the landlord pays to tenant the prevailing \\\\ntenancy premium to get the property vacated. Such properties in Maharashtra are governed by \\\\nMaharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999. \\\\n3. As per section 9(1) of the CGST Act there shall be levied central tax on the intra -State supplies of \\\\nservices. The scope of supply includes all forms of supply of goods and services or both such as sale, \\\\ntransfer, barter, exchange, licence, rental, lease or disposal made or agreed to be made for a \\\\nconsideration by a person in the course or furtherance of business and also includes the activities \\\\nspecified in Schedule II. The activity of transfer of tenancy right against consideration in the form of \\\\ntenancy premium is a supply of service liable to GST. It is a form of lease or renting of property and \\\\nsuch activity is specifically declared to be a service in para 2 of Schedule II i.e. any l ease, tenancy, \\\\neasement, licence to occupy land is a supply of services. \\\\n4. The contention that stamp duty and registration charges is levied on such transfers of tenancy \\\\nrights, and such transaction thus should not be subjected to GST, is not relevant. Me rely because a \\\\ntransaction or a supply involves execution of documents which may require registration and payment \\\\nof registration fee and stamp duty, would not preclude them from the scope of supply of goods and \\\\nservices and from payment of GST. The transf er of tenancy rights cannot be treated as sale of land or \\\\nbuilding declared as neither a supply of goods nor of services in para 5 of Schedule III to CGST Act, \\\\n2017. Thus, a consideration for the said activity shall attract levy of GST. \\\\n5. To sum up , the activity of transfer of ‘tenancy rights’ is squarely covered under the scope of \\\\nsupply and taxable per se . Transfer of tenancy rights to a new tenant against consideration in the form \\\\nof tenancy premium is taxable. However, renting of resid ential dwelling for use as a residence is \\\\nexempt [Sl. No. 12 of notification No. 12/2017 -Central Tax (Rate)]. Hence, grant of tenancy rights in \\\\na residential dwelling for use as residence dwelling against tenancy premium or periodic rent or \\\\nboth is exempt . As regards services provided by outgoing tenant by way of surrendering the tenancy \\\\nrights against consideration in the form of a portion of tenancy premium is liable to GST \\\\n2.1.12.9 Actionable claims, other than lottery, betting and gambling — Paragraph 6 of \\\\nSchedule III \\\\nParagraph 6 of Schedule III reads as under: \\\\nFor 01.07.2017 to 30.09.2023 \\\\n6.

       "  'ideal': 'Under GST, \"intermediary services\" are defined and regulated under Section 2(13) of the Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST) Act, 2017. An intermediary is a broker, agent, or any other person who arranges or facilitates the supply of goods, services, or securities between two or more persons but does not supply such goods, services, or securities on his own account. This definition emphasizes the role of an intermediary as a facilitator or arranger rather than a principal supplier.\\n\\n### Key Features of Intermediary Services: As per Circular No. 159/15/2021-GST, dated 22.09.2021\\n\\n1. **Minimum of Three Parties**: An intermediary service involves at least three parties:\\n - Two principals who are transacting in the supply of goods, services, or securities (the main supply).\\n - One intermediary who arranges or facilitates this main supply.\\n\\n2. **Two Distinct Supplies**:\\n - **Main Supply**: The core transaction of goods, services, or securities between the two principals.\\n - **Ancillary Supply**: The intermediary\\'s service of facilitating or arranging the main supply.\\n\\n3. **Nature of Service**:\\n - An intermediary does not alter the nature or value of the goods, services, or securities supplied.\\n - The intermediary\\'s service is distinctly separable from the main supply and often involves a commission.\\n\\n### Examples of Intermediary Services:\\n\\n1. **Freight Forwarder**:\\n - **As an Intermediary**: A freight forwarder arranging for international shipment acts as an intermediary\\n if they are not providing the transportation services themselves but facilitating the transaction between the\\n importer/exporter and the shipping company.\\n - **Not an Intermediary**: If the freight forwarder provides integrated transportation services and bills the customer directly for a combined service, they act on their own account and are not classified as an intermediary.\\n\\n2. **Commission Agent**:\\n - An agent who helps sell goods by finding buyers and facilitating the sale transaction between a supplier and buyer qualifies as an intermediary.\\n - **Illustration**: A person \\'C\\' helping a manufacturer \\'A\\' sell a machine to buyer \\'B\\' and charging \\'A\\' for this service is an intermediary.\\n\\n3. **Outsourcing Services**:\\n - **Not an Intermediary**: If a software company \\'A\\' outsources part of its development work to another company \\'C,\\' where \\'C\\' provides direct service (e.g., module development) to \\'A,\\' \\'C\\' is not an intermediary.\\n - **Intermediary**: If a firm \\'Q\\' in India arranges for \\'R\\' to process insurance claims for an insurance company \\'P\\' outside India and charges a commission for this facilitation, \\'Q\\' acts as an intermediary.\\n\\n### Place of Supply for Intermediary Services:\\n\\nThe determination of the place of supply is crucial for tax liability. As per Section 13(8) of the IGST Act, the place of supply for intermediary services is considered to be the location of the intermediary. This is noteworthy for determining GST applicability, especially in cross-border transactions.\\n\\n### Export of Services and Intermediary Services:\\n\\nIntermediary services do not qualify as \"export of services\" even if the intermediary facilitates transactions for entities outside India because the place of supply is considered the location of the intermediary (Section 13(8) of the IGST Act).\\n\\n### Judicial Pronouncements and Clarifications:\\n\\nIn Re: Fulcrum Global Info Services LLP 2019 (30) G.S.T.L. 261 (A.A.R. – GST-Karnataka), held that “Support services - Back-end support services\\nprovided to client under agreement - Scope of work include trade compliance operations management involving compliance screening relevant to client’s\\nbusiness, as instructed and trained by client, helpdesk support services including providing status of shipment to client’s internal and external customers and certain administrative tasks - Details of works entrusted to assessee by client showing that client outsourced its works to assessee and assessee providing his services either updating in system and if system not able to process work, updating it manually - No interaction between assessee and the third persons, either directly or indirectly and assessee concerned only with work entrusted to it on system - Assessee not involved as an intermediary - Assessee’s activities was support service provided to recipient of services - Services classifiable under SAC 9985 more specifically under Service Accounting Code 998599 as “Other support services nowhere else classified in terms of Notification No. 11/2017-C.T. (Rate) - Section 2(13) of Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017.\\n\\nIn Re: Infinera India Private Limited, 2020 (33) G.S.T.L. 491 (App. A.A.R. - GST - Kar.), held that “Intermediary Service - Pre-sale and marketing service\\nprovided by Appellant of the products of overseas client - Infinera US, in a “liaison capacity” is in the nature of facilitating the supply of the products of\\noverseas client and not supplying such goods on his own account - Appellant’s service not falling within the ambit of exclusion clause but appropriately\\nclassifiable as an “intermediary service’ as defined under Section 2(13) of Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017, there being no difference between the meaning of the term “intermediary” under the GST regime and pre-GST regime.”'},\n",

Applying the abovementioned guiding principles, the issue of intermediary services is clarified \\\\nthrough the following illustrations: \\\\nIllustration 1 \\\\n‘A’ is a manufacturer and supplier of a machine. ‘C’ helps ‘A’ in selli ng the machine by identifying \\\\nclient ‘B’ who wants to purchase this machine and helps in finalizing the contract of supply of machine \\\\nby ‘A’ to ‘B’. ‘C’ charges ‘A’ for his services of locating ‘B’ and helping in finalizing the sale of \\\\nmachine between ‘A’ and ‘B’, for which ‘C’ invoices ‘A’ and is paid by ‘A’ for the same. While ‘A’ \\\\nand ‘B’ are involved in the main supply of the machinery, ‘C’, is facilitating the supply of machine \\\\nbetween ‘A’ and ‘B’. In this arrangement, ‘C’ is providing the ancillary sup ply of arranging or \\\\nfacilitating the ‘main supply’ of machinery between ‘A’ and ‘B’ and therefore, ‘C’ is an intermediary \\\\nand is providing intermediary service to ‘A’. \\\\nIllustration 2 \\\\n‘A’ is a software company which develops software for the clients as per their requirement. \\\\n‘A’ has a contract with ‘B’ for providing some customized software for its business operations. \\\\n‘A’ outsources the task of design and development of a particular module of the software to ‘C’, for \\\\nwhich “C’ may have to interact with ‘B’, to know their specific requirements. In this case, ‘C’ is \\\\nproviding main supply of service of design and development of software to ‘A’, and thus, ‘C’ is not an \\\\nintermediary in this case. \\\\nIllustration 3 \\\\nAn insurance company ‘P’, located outside India, req uires to process insurance claims of its clients in \\\\nrespect of the insurance service being provided by ‘P’ to the clients. For processing insurance claims, \\\\n‘P’ decides to outsource this work to some other firm. For this purpose, he approaches ‘Q’, located in \\\\nIndia, for arranging insurance claims processing service from other service providers in India. ‘Q’ \\\\ncontacts ‘R’, who is in business of providing such insurance claims processing service and arranges \\\\nsupply of insurance claims processing service by ‘R’ to ‘P’. ‘Q’ charges P a commission or service \\\\ncharge of 1% of the contract value of insurance claims processing service provided by ‘R’ to ‘P’. In \\\\nsuch a case, main supply of insurance claims processing service is between ‘P’ and ‘R’, while ‘Q’ is \\\\nmerely a rranging or facilitating the supply of services between ‘P’ and ‘R’, and not himself providing \\\\nthe main supply of services. Accordingly, in this case, ‘Q’ acts as an intermediary as per definition of \\\\nsub-section (13) of section 2 of the IGST Act. \\\\nIllustrat ion 4 \\\\n‘A’ is a manufacturer and supplier of computers based in USA and supplies its goods all over the \\\\nworld.

       "    'content': 'As an expert legal consultant, provide a detailed response to the question below, considering the given context: Place of supply of goods or services or both 4.175 \\\\n2.3 From the perusal of the definition of “intermediary” under IGST Act as well as under Service Tax \\\\nlaw, it is evident that there is broadly no change in the scope of intermediary services in the GST \\\\nregime vis-à-vis the Service Tax regime, except addition of supply of securities in the definition of \\\\nintermediary in the GST Law. \\\\n3. Primary Requirements for intermediary services \\\\nThe concept of intermediary services, as defined above, requires some basic pre -requisites, which are \\\\ndiscussed below: \\\\n3.1 Minimum of Three Parties : By definition, an intermediary is someone who arranges or facilitates \\\\nthe supplies of goods or services or securities between two or more persons. It is thus a natural \\\\ncorollary that the a rrangement requires a minimum of three parties, two of them transacting in the \\\\nsupply of goods or services or securities (the main supply) and one arranging or facilitating (the \\\\nancillary supply) the said main supply. An activity between only two parties c an, therefore, not be \\\\nconsidered as an intermediary service. An intermediary essentially “arranges or facilitates” another \\\\nsupply (the “main supply”) between two or more other persons and, does not himself provide the main \\\\nsupply. \\\\n3.2 Two distinct supplies : Following are two distinct supplies in case of provision of intermediary \\\\nservices : \\\\n(1) Main supply , between the two principals, which can be a supply of goods or services or \\\\nsecurities. \\\\n(2) Ancillary supply , which is the service of facilitating or arrang ing the main supply between the \\\\ntwo principals. This ancillary supply is supply of intermediary service and is clearly identifiable \\\\nand distinguished from the main supply. \\\\nA person involved in supply of main supply on principal -to-principal basis to anothe r person cannot be \\\\nconsidered as supplier of intermediary service. \\\\n3.3 Intermediary service provider to have the character of an agent, broker or any other similar \\\\nperson : The definition of “intermediary” itself provides that intermediary service provider means a \\\\nbroker, an agent or any other person, by whatever name called ….” This part of the definition is not \\\\ninclusive but uses the expression “means” and does not expand the definition by any known expression \\\\nof expansion such as “and includes”. The use o f the expression “arranges or facilitates” in the \\\\ndefinition of “intermediary” suggests a subsidiary role for the intermediary. It must arrange or facilitate \\\\nsome other supply, which is the main supply, and does not himself provides the main supply. Thus, the \\\\nrole of intermediary is only supportive. \\\\n3.4 Does not include a person who supplies such goods or services or both or securities on his \\\\nown account: The definition of intermediary services specifically mentions that intermediary “ does \\\\nnot include a per son who supplies such goods or services or both or securities on his own account”. \\\\nUse of word “ such ” in the definition with reference to supply of goods or services refers to the main \\\\nsupply of goods or services or both, or securities, between two or more persons, which are arranged or \\\\nfacilitated by the intermediary. It implies that in cases wherein the person supplies the main supply, \\\\neither fully or partly, on principal -to-principal basis, the said supply cannot be covered under the scope \\\\nof “intermedia ry”. \\\\n3.5 Sub -contracting for a service is not an intermediary service: An important exclusion from \\\\nintermediary is sub -contracting. The supplier of main service may decide to outsource the supply of the \\\\nmain service, either fully or partly, to one or more sub-contractors. Such sub -contractor provides the \\\\nmain supply, either fully or a part thereof, and does not merely arrange or facilitate the main supply \\\\nbetween the principal supplier and his customers, and therefore, clearly is not an intermediary. For \\\\ninstance, ‘A’ and ‘B’ have entered into a contract as per which ‘A’ needs to provide a service of, say, \\\\nAnnual Maintenance of tools and machinery to ‘B’. ‘A’ subcontracts a part or whole of it to ‘C’. \\\\nAccordingly, ‘C’ provides the service of annual maintenan ce to ‘A’ as part of such sub -contract, by \\\\nproviding annual maintenance of tools and machinery to the customer of ‘A’, i.e., to ‘B’ on behalf of \\\\n‘A’. Though ‘C’ is dealing with the customer of ‘A’, but ‘C’ is providing main supply of Annual'},\n",

This definition clearly implies that the scope of intermediary is much wider than \\\\ncommission agent as understood in common commercial parlance. Commission agent, in common \\\\ncommerci al parlance, means a person who causes sale or purchase of goods whereas intermediary \\\\nmeans a person who arranges or facilitate supply of goods or services or both or securities. Arranging \\\\nor facilitating supply of goods or services or both or securities i s much wider than causing sale or \\\\npurchase of goods or services or both or securities. Services likely to be covered in the phrase \\\\n“arranging or facilitating supply of goods or services or both or securities” will certainly be much \\\\nwider and comprehensive as compared to “causing sale or purchase of goods or services or both or \\\\nsecurities .” \\\\nWhat are “Intermediary Services”? \\\\nGenerally, an “intermediary” is a person who arranges or facilitates a supply of goods or services or \\\\nboth or securities between two pe rsons, without material alteration or further processing. Thus, an \\\\nintermediary is involved with two supplies at any one time: \\\\n(i) the supply between the principal and the third party; and \\\\n(ii) the supply of his own service (agency service) to his principal, f or which a fee or commission \\\\nis usually charged. \\\\nFor the purpose of this section exclusion has been provided to a person who arranges or facilitates \\\\nsupply of goods or services or both or securities on his own account. In order to determine whether a \\\\nperson is acting as an intermediary or not, the following factors need to be considered: — \\\\nNature and value : An intermediary cannot alter the nature or value of goods or service or both or \\\\nsecurities, the supply of which he facilitates on behalf of his princi pal, although the principal may \\\\nauthorize the intermediary to negotiate a different price. Also, the principal must know the exact value \\\\nat which the goods or service or both or securities are supplied on his behalf and any discounts that the \\\\nintermediary obtains must be passed back to the principal. \\\\nSeparation of value : The value of an intermediary’s service is invariably identifiable from the main \\\\nsupply of goods or service or both or securities that he is arranging. It can be based on an agreed \\\\npercenta ge of the supply price. The amount charged by an agent from his principal is referred to as \\\\n“commission .” \\\\nIdentity and title : The service provided by the intermediary on behalf of the principal is clearly \\\\nidentifiable. \\\\nIn accordance with the above guiding principles, services supplied by the following persons will \\\\nqualify as ‘intermediary services ’:— \\\\n(i) Travel Agent (any mode of travel) \\\\n(ii) Tour Operator \\\\n(iii) Commission agent of goods or services or both or securities \\\\n(iv) Recovery Agent \\\\nEven in other cases, wherever a supplier of any goods or service or both or securities acts as an agent \\\\nfor another person, as identified by the guiding principles outlined above, this provision will apply. \\\\nNormally, it is expected that the intermediary or agent w ould have documentary evidence authorizing \\\\nhim to act on behalf of the provider of the ‘main supplier'},\n",

      "• The scope of the phrase ‘specified actionable claims’ has now been made quite wide by virtue of the amendment because it includes not only lottery, betting and gambling but casinos, horse racing and online money gaming also. \n",
      "\n",
      "• Further, specified actionable claims shall be subject to GST. This amendment shall override the provisions of any other law for the time being in force, providing for prohibiting, restricting or regulating betting, casino, gambling, horse racing, lottery or online gaming.\n",
      "\n",
      "• In essence, barring specified actionable claims, other actionable claims shall fall within the purview of Paragraph 6 of Schedule III. Putting this simply, the activities of betting, casinos, gambling, horse racing, lottery and online money gaming shall be subject to GST at the applicable rates as per the amended GST law.\n",

      "Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The scope of the term ‘actionable claims’ which is subjected to GST has widened on account of recent amendments. Activities such as casinos, horse racing and online money gaming have entered the ambit of GST taxability on account of such amendments. \n",
      "This tax amendment serves as a crucial clarification, effectively resolving numerous litigation issues that have arisen on this subject matter.\n",
      "************\n",
      "[Submitted Answer]: Under the CGST Act, 2017, the term \"actionable claim\" is defined with reference to Section 3 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882. An actionable claim refers to a claim to any debt or beneficial interest in movable property that the civil courts recognize as affording grounds for relief. It excludes debts secured by mortgage of immovable property or by hypothecation or pledge of movable property.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of GST implications, actionable claims are considered as goods under the GST regime. As per Schedule III of the CGST Act, 2017, activities or transactions which are treated as neither a supply of goods nor a supply of services include actionable claims, other than lottery, betting, and gambling. This means that actionable claims are not considered as a supply of goods or services for the purpose of GST.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it is essential to note that the transfer or assignment of actionable claims is subject to GST. The transfer of actionable claims is considered as a taxable supply under GST, attracting tax liability. The transfer of actionable claims falls under the definition of \"supply\" as per Section 7 of the CGST Act, 2017, and is liable to GST if it is done in the course or furtherance of business.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, while actionable claims themselves may not attract GST, any transfer or assignment of actionable claims would be subject to GST. It is crucial for businesses and individuals dealing with actionable claims to understand the GST implications and ensure compliance with the relevant provisions of the CGST Act, 2017.\n",
