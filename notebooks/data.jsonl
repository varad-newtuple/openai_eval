The issue has been examined. The transfer of tenancy rights against tenancy premium which is \\nalso known as \u201cpagadi system\u201d is prevalent in some States. In this system the tenant acquires, tenancy \\nrights in the property against payment of tenancy premium ( pagadi). The landlord may be owner of the \\nproperty but the possession of the same lies with the tenant. The tenant pays periodic rent to the \\nlandlord as long as he occupies the property. The tenant also usually has the option to sell the tenancy \\nright of t he said property and in such a case has to share a percentage of the proceed with owner of \\nland, as laid down in their tenancy agreement. Alternatively, the landlord pays to tenant the prevailing \\ntenancy premium to get the property vacated. Such properties in Maharashtra are governed by \\nMaharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999. \\n3. As per section 9(1) of the CGST Act there shall be levied central tax on the intra -State supplies of \\nservices. The scope of supply includes all forms of supply of goods and services or both such as sale, \\ntransfer, barter, exchange, licence, rental, lease or disposal made or agreed to be made for a \\nconsideration by a person in the course or furtherance of business and also includes the activities \\nspecified in Schedule II. The activity of transfer of tenancy right against consideration in the form of \\ntenancy premium is a supply of service liable to GST. It is a form of lease or renting of property and \\nsuch activity is specifically declared to be a service in para 2 of Schedule II i.e. any l ease, tenancy, \\neasement, licence to occupy land is a supply of services. \\n4. The contention that stamp duty and registration charges is levied on such transfers of tenancy \\nrights, and such transaction thus should not be subjected to GST, is not relevant. Me rely because a \\ntransaction or a supply involves execution of documents which may require registration and payment \\nof registration fee and stamp duty, would not preclude them from the scope of supply of goods and \\nservices and from payment of GST. The transf er of tenancy rights cannot be treated as sale of land or \\nbuilding declared as neither a supply of goods nor of services in para 5 of Schedule III to CGST Act, \\n2017. Thus, a consideration for the said activity shall attract levy of GST. \\n5. To sum up , the activity of transfer of \u2018tenancy rights\u2019 is squarely covered under the scope of \\nsupply and taxable per se . Transfer of tenancy rights to a new tenant against consideration in the form \\nof tenancy premium is taxable. However, renting of resid ential dwelling for use as a residence is \\nexempt [Sl.

The issue has been examined. The transfer of tenancy rights against tenancy premium which is \\nalso known as \u201cpagadi system\u201d is prevalent in some States. In this system the tenant acquires, tenancy \\nrights in the property against payment of tenancy premium ( pagadi). The landlord may be owner of the \\nproperty but the possession of the same lies with the tenant. The tenant pays periodic rent to the \\nlandlord as long as he occupies the property. The tenant also usually has the option to sell the tenancy \\nright of t he said property and in such a case has to share a percentage of the proceed with owner of \\nland, as laid down in their tenancy agreement. Alternatively, the landlord pays to tenant the prevailing \\ntenancy premium to get the property vacated. Such properties in Maharashtra are governed by \\nMaharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999. \\n3. As per section 9(1) of the CGST Act there shall be levied central tax on the intra -State supplies of \\nservices. The scope of supply includes all forms of supply of goods and services or both such as sale, \\ntransfer, barter, exchange, licence, rental, lease or disposal made or agreed to be made for a \\nconsideration by a person in the course or furtherance of business and also includes the activities \\nspecified in Schedule II. The activity of transfer of tenancy right against consideration in the form of \\ntenancy premium is a supply of service liable to GST. It is a form of lease or renting of property and \\nsuch activity is specifically declared to be a service in para 2 of Schedule II i.e. any l ease, tenancy, \\neasement, licence to occupy land is a supply of services. \\n4. The contention that stamp duty and registration charges is levied on such transfers of tenancy \\nrights, and such transaction thus should not be subjected to GST, is not relevant. Me rely because a \\ntransaction or a supply involves execution of documents which may require registration and payment \\nof registration fee and stamp duty, would not preclude them from the scope of supply of goods and \\nservices and from payment of GST. The transf er of tenancy rights cannot be treated as sale of land or \\nbuilding declared as neither a supply of goods nor of services in para 5 of Schedule III to CGST Act, \\n2017. Thus, a consideration for the said activity shall attract levy of GST. \\n5. To sum up , the activity of transfer of \u2018tenancy rights\u2019 is squarely covered under the scope of \\nsupply and taxable per se . Transfer of tenancy rights to a new tenant against consideration in the form \\nof tenancy premium is taxable. However, renting of resid ential dwelling for use as a residence is \\nexempt [Sl.
